    "prompt": "I remember one time when I was working at an arts and crafts store in custom framing. I was washing my hands in the restroom when I noticed a woman was waiting and looking at me wide eyed and seemingly afraid. I couldn’t think of anything that could have caused her to react that way other than when I rolled my sleeves up to wash my hands, exposing my scars. I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife. I had a completely normal conversation with the husband and the wife never did speak a word to me. I think if I didn’t find it so bizarre, it would have affected me more, but it is weird how people view those who self-harm.\n\nThe primary way I self harm (though it certainly hasn’t been the only way) is by scratching, so I’m usually able to come up with stories such as getting a neighbor’s cat out of a tree or getting caught on a thorn when working in the garden, neither of which I’ve actually done. The scars don’t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I’m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.\nAlthough I haven’t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I’ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with. It’s definitely not fun and can feel belittling and even dehumanizing.",

    "prompt": "Luckily I was drunk enough that I don't remember the fine details. I was camping at a local event, where a couple hundred or so college students get together and have party camp over memorial day weekend. Well i started getting tipsy, normally I'm pretty careful, but it was about 10 so it was getting dark. I decided to run back to my tent to get glow sticks and I slipped on some loose leaves. All I remember is hearing the nastiest pop I'd ever heard in my life. I just grabbed my leg and pleased to myself for my let to not be broken. Well there was nothing I could do about it then so I did what any drunken fool would do. I crawled into my tent and went to sleep. Good thing I brought my air mattress and had it filled to ideal pressure. The next morning I wake up (but not before two stumbling, drunken leaks on the ant covered tree next to our tent) and my ankle is twice the size of my other leg. I stay in bed a few more hours until my buddy wakes up and I tell him about it. He doesn't think it's broken because of how chill I'm being. So I try to get out of bed. He helps me over to the picnic table and I start just pouring sweat, my vision starts fading, he's telling me I'm turning green. That's when I knew it was serious. So I lay down in the backseat of his car and he takes me to the nearest hospital which was in Redding, CA about a thirty minute drive. So the bone wasn't the worst part. Apparently I tore most of the ligements and a couple tendons in my ankle so it's safe to assume I spent the last 2 months on my couch.\n\nTl;dr: Alcohol + running + loose leaves = a bad time.",

Me, my friend and mother were all involved.\n\nLuckily, I got the worst of the aesthetic injuries, but my mother broke her neck and had a stroke and such. She made a full recovery and is walking/talking to this day. My friend walked away with cuts and bruises. Everything in the car (electronics, clothes, laptops) survived, except the car itself. I'm extremely lucky that I walked away with an almost missing arm only. Don't know what caused the split though, whether it was just pressure from the car on top of it, or if it was a shard of glass tearing through.\n\nI was life flighted to Vegas where I got stitched up. My muscle had torn all the way through (that's all tendon and ligaments), and that had to be sutured, my skin was stapled back together. I got a skin graft about 2 months later and now it's almost fully healed.\n\nMore images of the following months [here in this album](<URL>\n\nRolling in a car is definitely an unreal experience. I constantly dream of the night that it happened, the rolling playing over in my head again and again. Luckily, a doctor and nurse were some of the first to stop and help. Definitely thankful for everyone who helped me.\n\nOh, and by the way, life flights cost about $44,000 in case you were all wondering. That and all my other bills amounted to ~$150,000 that night.

One side is a tribal scorpion that's very thick and heavy ink and it covered the scars great, it was uncomfortable every time he was on top of one of them, but it worked out great. The only indication of scarring is you can kinda feel it if you run your hands over it.  My other thigh has a very large and detailed dream catcher on it and you can still see the scars through the feathers on the bottom because of the light shading that was required. I've been told I can have it gone over again and it would hide them a little better but I'm not sure as going over old ink hurts pretty good. I have a shitty home-done tattoo on my calf and it mostly covered the scars but it wasn't a great experience and I hate that ink a lot. I want a piece done on my forearm where most of my scars are but I'm hunting for the perfect artist to draw it for me because I suck at art.

Patients typically have some type of trauma to a region of tissue that results in inflammation, leading to swelling and thus cutting off arterial blood supply. The compartment of fascia holding the muscle in place increases in pressure as the tissue occupying it swells more and more. This will then cause veins in the compartment to collapse thus resulting in very poor blood flow in and out, leading to tissue ischemia (death due to lack of O2). \n\nIf any docs or healthcare workers see this pathophys feel free to correct me, I'm just a med student tryin to learn!",

    "prompt": "Preface - PLEASE READ!:This is the sixteenth part of what is a running story. It is all about the taboo. You will not find romance here. Any notion and talk of love is subverted to serve the taboo. Anal sex and incest are MAJOR themes of this story. You may want to not read this part and other parts if you take offence to any of the following in a lurid, obscene (and of course fantastical) context: incest, rough sex, submission and domination, degradation, extreme sodomy, ass worship, extreme dirty assplay, light or implied scat, farting, and EFRO (erotic female relieving observance). All characters involved are 18 or older. This particular story is a change from all that filthy anal that preceded it. <Person>'s ass needs a break - however brief! Instead, there is a strong impregnation fantasy (yes, fantasy) theme in this part. Again, I am thankful for all my readers, patient fans, and especially comments, ratings and emails. Hopefully one day, with your help, I may get one of my stories rated high enough to be 'Hot'. Very close but no cigar!P. S. The fantasy is everything. *It is the next day and the start of the holidays. You haven't done much since your particularly filthy last episode, except to squeeze your daughter's amazing curves while <Person> kissing her in the shower, your penis lodged deep in her butt, and doing something highly similar in the bedroom afterwards, <Person> falling asleep with her thumb in her mouth and her pink pyjama bottoms pulled just down enough to keep your softening penis still inside her bottom. The late morning light filters in the room through the curtains. You are freshly showered and towelling your hair, wearing another towel around your waist. You look up to see <Person> standing in the doorway in a little pink top and tiny panties with a cartoon kitten's face on them. Her hand is down them and you can see her moving her fingers around. 'Daddy, can you go in my little pussy?' she says, suddenly sounding rather shy and innocent. You look up at her smiling, and then change your face to mock shock. 'Honey, we can't do that, I'm your father!' you say, rather convincingly you think. <Person> giggles and then makes her face look upset and desperate. 'But daddy I neeeed it. It'll be fun I promise! You know you want to know what it's like inside your daughter's silly tight pussy. ' She steps closer. 'Of course I do -- I mean, no! Honey no matter how small and warm and wet your pussy is. . . ''Don't forget tight!''And super tight, I'm sure, the fact is that daddy's shouldn't do things like that, it's wrong. ''But wrong things are so, like, fun and cool and stuff! Am I not pretty enough daddy?' She steps right up to, and you put your hands on her waist. 'Of course you are silly! You're gorgeous and any man would find you completely fuckable!''Including you daddy?''Yes, I mean, well, we shouldn't even be talking like this!'She frowns. 'Is it because my boobies aren't big enough?''No! Honey your breasts are huge for your age, they look amazing! I bet all other girls are jealous. ''But you won't even touch them. ' She looks so sad. 'Because. . . because. . . It's not like that. . . 'She picks up your hands and places them on her breasts. 'There we go, now squeeze them. 'You do so, mauling them through her shirt with disguised delight. 'They do feel amazing baby, but I'm not sure we should be -''Maybe it's my ass, maybe you're another person that thinks my butt is too big and silly. ''Baby, your ass is amazing, it's perfect! I love how big it is!' You move your hands from her chest and clamp them to her ass, squeezing it hard and opening it up with your hands. <Person> smiles. 'Good good, maybe you can put it in my bum later too!''Baby now that's going too far! What kind of father would I be if I made love to my daughter's big bottom?''A great one! You know you'd love it, bumming your busty teenage daughter. ''I know I would honey, but I don't think you'd like it. ''I bet I would daddy. I bet I'd love to feel your big thing deep in my fat bum while you kissed me and told me how pretty I am. ' She is grinding her pussy on your knee at this point. You groan. 'Okay, okay, look. We can compromise. If I go in your pussy just for a bit, just for today, will you stop asking for all this stuff?''Maybe daddy!' She grins impishly. You sigh. 'That's the best I'll get. Right, let's pull these silly panties down and get you sorted. ''Yayy!' She claps her hands together and bounces on her heels. She wriggles as you help her out of her pants, moving them slowly over the stuck out largeness of her rear. You squeeze her ass over and under her panties, taking your time to remove them. She makes no effort to help you. 'I can't do it myself daddy, I need your help. ''Aw you silly baby' you say gently",

    "prompt": "was in shock, but I did as I was told. I opened my shirt, but <Person> ripped it open wider, popping the buttons in the process. \"Daddy, I haven't got another shirt to wear. \" <Person> just laughed. My tits were out on show and I was so red from embarrassment and humiliation, which seemed to make Dad's cock even harder. He started to maul my tits. \"Mmm, bitch, you have a fine pair of tits, now use them to jack me off,\" Dad said coldly. I pressed my tits together. \"Get your bra off, you dumb bitch!\" So off came my bra. I squeezed his cock between my tits and built up a rhythm. I started to enjoy it, and I opened my mouth to take his cock in my mouth like I did every day. Dad soon came in my mouth, and I swallowed as usual. I started to get up, and Dad said, \"Where do you think you are going now, bitch? You're a nasty little slut just like your mother, and we have to do something about it, don't we?\" I was wet between my legs as usual and Dad knew it. \"Now let's see that little virgin pussy of yours. and it had better still be a virgin cunt!\" Dad slapped me down to the floor. \"Did I tell you to get up bitch?\". I whined, \"But I will be late for school!\"\"Bitch! The only real lessons you need to learn I will teach you,\" Dad shouted to me. I was crying and semi-naked on the floor. Dad just laughed. \"You know bitch, sluts don't wear panties because they just get in the way, and from now on you don't wear any, either. Understand me?\". I just nodded as my tears stopped me from making any sense. Dad got me down on my knees, tore my shirt off my back, and ripped my skirt off me. All I had on was my pink little cotton panties with teddy bears on them, which were now completely soaking wet. \"Look at yourself, bitch. You're so fucking wet and you want it so much, so I've decided that I am going to take your virginity. . . . And I hope some pathetic little boy at school has not yet taken it. \" I shook my head. \"Good, good, bitch. \" He took his shirt off and I was amazed to see my Daddy was surprisingly very well physically fit. He had a powerful looking chest and six-pack abs, and this just made my cunt even wetter. Dad started to maul my body, and my body started to betray me. I was moaning like bitch in heat!Dad ripped off my panties and started to finger my cunt. \"You're so wet down there; I am just going to slid it in, bitch. Oh, and next time I want your cunt completely shaved,\" Dad told me. I was lost in lust and just moaned,\"Yes Daddy. \" My world was spinning and I was hopelessly and helplessly lost in it. I just watched as dad finger-fucked me—he started with two and then stepped it up to four. I was so close to having my first real orgasm and Dad just carried on. He suddenly stopped. \"It's not about you, bitch. I am the one in control here. and this will always be about tending to my needs, not yours. Don't you ever forget that, slut!. \"Dad threw me to the floor. I was completely naked and soaking wet. \"Get on all fours—just like when you suck me off, bitch!\" I got on my hands and knees and I presented my ass to him. \"Just like this Daddy?\" I asked, wanting to please him as no other woman had. \"You learn quickly. Now for your lesson, bitch. \" He was merciless as he put his cock at my entry and forced himself deep into me. I felt every inch as he ripped through my hymen without any regard for me at all. I would have screamed from the sheer pain of it, but my lust got the better of me. I was moaning, \"Yes. . . ! Yes. . . ! Yes. . . !\" This caught me totally unaware, but my mind was racing and I was totally lost in a strange, new world of pleasure that I found frightening, yet highly arousing. <Person> shot his seed deep inside of me. I was so happy that I was able to bring pleasure to my Daddy. I never even noticed that he had an evil look in his eye, and had absolutely no inkling what he had in mind for me later. I could go everywhere throughout the whole house, except the basement, which was always kept locked. . . . *how can i say it in words i'm honured to know you DragonSlayer and thanks again for your editing skills as i learn.",

Parents expect schools to inform them if their kids get into fights, cut classes, are diagnosed with a disease, are showing signs of suicidality, etc. And the state expects schools to inform the police of students show signs of abuse, etc.\n\nLegally, schools act *in loco parentis* and minors in schools have no expectation or right to privacy with regard to schools hiding things from parents.\n\nSo this doesn't violate trans children's rights. They have no such right to violate, same as other children.\n\n&gt; <Organization> are trying to ban things like hormone blockers for teens and other things that make it harder for people to transition.\n\nNo one im America has any right to any medical treatment whatsoever, except seriously injured people who make it to an ER -- they can't legally be pushed into the street and abandoned by the hospital. \n\nAnd no one has a right to any specific treatment -- if you want viagra and the doctors tell you no, for whatever reason, your rights have not been violated.\n\nSo this does not violate trans rights, either.\n\n&gt; There’s a reason why trans people face such high suicide rates and it’s from an uncaring and hateful attitude perpetuated against them.\n\n81% of transgender people have one or more personality disorders, with NPD being number one at 57%. This likely explains most trans suicide attempts. Many groups face an uncaring and hateful world and it's rare for more than a token few members to commit suicide. Blacks are a good example. Jews are an even better one -- violently hated by the entirety of <Organization> German society, persecuted, expropriated, regularly beaten and terrorised, and then sent off to slave labor and/or extermination camps, yet their suicide rate barely rose.\n\nExternal factors do not account for the trans suicide rate. Which, by the way, is not much higher than the non-trans rate in adolescents.",

    "prompt": "or twice she had had this vision of a guy she'd never meet, perhaps in a foreign country, jerking off while looking at her, his thick cum splashing all over her photo. But she knew that was just a fantasy. . . )After her shower she decided to do something different and give <Person> a treat. She sat down on the edge of the bath, opened her warm soft thighs and carefully shaved every scrap of pubic hair from her. She knew <Person> liked feeling her like a very young teen and, after all, it was a special day. What surprised her was how exciting she found it. She sat for some time just stroking her little girl's cunt, feeling its smoothness. Her inner lips had disappeared while she'd been showering and so now all there was to see was a lovely soft pink slit between her thighs. She remembered how once before, while still at school, she'd sat on a bed admiring just such a slit between just such a pair of smooth thighs. Oh yes; she'd been so in lust with Candy that summer. . . She'd discovered so much about herself that year and even now she imagined from time to time that she could taste <Person>'s pussy. Her thick juices smelt so animal and when they made love her nose, mouth and chin were covered in <Person>'s fluids. She'd never dreamt that she'd ever allow herself to drink another girl's pee, let alone enjoy it, - but she did. Oh God, she'd adored <Person> and her piss had tasted like nectar as it splashed and dribbled all over her face - she just couldn't gulp enough of it to satisfy her desires. And the thrill of standing over a naked <Person>, opening her legs and emptying herself over her lover was almost too much to bear. She was so in love with <Person> - it was if her gushing pee was actually carrying her love and covering <Person> in her desire. Such memories, but such heartache when <Person> had to move away that fall. She thought she'd die sobbing. . . <Person> knew she couldn't allow herself another session on the bed, but she gave into another temptation. Her smooth pussy had excited her, so she fetched out the camera and took plenty of photos of her lovely nude body. Many were very explicitly concentrated on her cunt, both closed like a little girl's and gently spread to allow her inner lips to flower again. Others were of the whole of her, both standing in front of the mirrors in the bedroom and posing on the bed. By using the delay, she could take nice pics of herself from behind as she kneeled and spread her legs. She'd look at them when she was alone. Another excuse for a private session. . . She carefully saved the photos in her secret folder on the PC. God knows what she'd say if <Person> ever found them. It was a little sexy ritual she'd been doing for years. Heavens, tucked away carefully in her lingerie drawer she had Polaroids Candy had taken of her when she'd still been at school! God; <Person> would be so shocked to find those. He'd be so disappointed in her. . . And she knew what she was about to do. It was only sensible to check whether they were still safe. . . She felt to the back of her drawer and her finger closed around the packet with that familiar thrill. Just checking that they're still safe. . . Makes sense just to look inside to reassure herself that they're still all there. . . And there she was, from all that time ago. Her girly grin shining out down the years, love for her friend burning from her eyes. Kneeling on the bed, cupping her adolescent breasts (quite nice, even then, she noted!); here showing her butt and glistening pussy to <Person>; some more, close ups, with her fingers deep inside her; and then others, taken shortly after, with her licking her fingers. Nearly one hundred in total, documenting a few months' young love, exhibiting herself in eager but fairly unsophisticated poses for her beautiful lover. Oh God, even now <Person> could feel the ache in her belly. And here were the most explicit, taken only days before the crushing news that shattered that summer - a few pics of each of them licking the other's pussy. She remembered with a smile that they messed about with the camera's self-timer for ages to get those shots right - but she was still impressed with the results even now. The love shone out from their eyes and there was nothing posed about the enthusiasm - they couldn't have buried their mouths any deeper in their lovers' cunts. She could actually see <Person>'s juice glistening on <Person>'s nose in one shot. It was familiar, the mix of emotions whenever she took this journey back in time. Yes; her hand had strayed down and yes, her fingers were sticky again but it was almost a fondle for comfort. Of equal intensity was this longing, still, for a youthful intense love that had been denied them. True; she now enjoyed herself every week or so with India from the gym for a few hours but she knew that she'd never ever replace <Person> in her heart. That realisation served to put <Person>'s \"sensible head\" back on. She self-consciously gave a little cough; stood up sharply and gave herself a little talking to. Time was moving on and she had plenty to do to prepare for her special night with <Person>. To be continued. . .",

    "prompt": "I'm so sorry hun. I kinda had a similar story when I was a freshman (14yrs) i thought i was such cool shit for dating a senior. But one day I had stayed after school to finish up a project with a classmate and when I came out he was just standing their waiting for me. Which was super unexpected I didnt even know he knew. The afterschool bus wasnt going to come for almost an hour so we walked around for a bit, and then he brought me into the theater room. He started kissing and groping me and I got scared. I kept making every excuse in the book, ie. I dont want to miss the bus, we could get caught, etc. And i was also visibly shaking which he even noticed and commented on. At this point we were on the stage but after he asked why I was shaking he tried to \"make me more comfortable\" and brought me down to the seats. He started touching me, but I did get kind of \"lucky\" in sense that he only sexually assaulted me and didnt penetrate and rape me. I think eventually he realized what he was doing and stopped and apologized. But when I got home I told my friend. She thought I was leaving parts out of the story and told her mom who worked at the school that he raped me. Her mom then told the principal and guidance counselor who got the authorities involved it became this huge thing. And all they ever kept asking me was if he raped me which he didnt so I said no. Eventually they had to drop it. But he told the entire school that I tried ruining him and falsely accused him. And because I denied it and didnt press charges on him, somehow that made me look more guilty. I also stayed friends with the girl, which people thought made me look worse, but I stayed friends with her because I knew she thought she was just doing the right thing as a friend. I became the school pariah and was constantly bullied and had death threats. My own adopted father told me he thinks I lied about it. I wish I had just told the truth back then, but years have passed now and everyone's moved on, but I still have to live with it",

    "prompt": "A child bride from Colorado recently came out to be interviewed, urging the state of Colorado to reconsider the age to wed. She herself was married at the age of 14 to a man who was 34 years old. A twenty year age gap between a man and, really a child, is quite alarming. The gap was so alarming, in fact, that state lawmakers banned minors from entering into common-law marriages in the year of their marriage in 2006. Ceremonial marriages were never addressed, though. So there have been over 2,200 underage marriages since 2006.\n\nThe fourteen year old’s thirty-four year old husband was put in jail for sexual assault, which was not overruled by their marriage because a judge deemed it illegal. While they had parental consent for the marriage, they apparently did not have a judge’s approval according to police and court records. The wife claims that she wishes she had never gone through with the marriage and stated that no one knows what they want or what love is at the age of fourteen. Eighteen should be the age limit for marrying, she encouraged.\n\nThe <Organization> has a set a goal of the year 2030 by which all child marriages should be illegal. While perhaps not all underage marriages are for sexual assault reasons or human trafficking, the ban will certainly help eliminate a vast number of cases where it is the underlying motive for the union. Even while wed, sexual assault is illegal, just as domestic violence is. If you are in an underage or adult marriage and experiencing abuse of any degree, do not wait for things to escalate. The child bride mentioned here mentioned wanting to file for a divorce years later. For all questions related to divorce and/or domestic violence or abuse, please do not hesitate to call <Organization> today.",

Even if it wasn't something sexual, it's still something that's painful for you, and it was on your butt. This doesn't seem like a \"small trigger\" at all. If my partner changed their mind and told me not to pop a pimple of theirs that they had previously asked me to pop, I would back off immediately - and I have a compulsive disorder that makes me obsess over picking at and popping pimples! It's so freaky and weird that he would say \"you don't have a choice\", especially if he knows what you've been through.\n\nBut even if he doesn't know - he should realize how terrifying this is to hear for women. It's literally your body! Honestly, I would even say that because he touched you (and hurt you) when you didn't want him to, you would be fully justified in calling this assault, no matter how small it might seem to you. You'd call it assault if a stranger came up to you and tried to pop a pimple on your face while you begged them to stop, right? This isn't any different because you know him better.\n\nEven if he apologizes, I don't think you're obligated to move past this at all.

    "prompt": "I think it is unethical to eat your own species. Also it carries the risk of contracting Prion diseases like CJD and Kuru, though if you avoid eating the brain you should be good. I don't think evidence of past infanticide and cannibalism justifies doing it currently. \n\nHowever, I see morality as a spectrum rather than a binary thing. If you are starving to death, you might aswell eat the baby as it won't survive on its own and you can just have another when resources are plentiful. Eating a human would be less ethical/more morally wrong than a working class animal, which would be more unethical than eating any random animal, which would be more unethical that eating a plant, which would be more unethical than just eating the fruit of the plant and dispersing the seeds, which could be considered a net positive.\n\nI think we can attribute the usefulness of a species to society as a contributer to its value. Ie, if you had to chose who to live, it would be morally better to pick a doctor over a murderer.\n\nAs for humans being of negative value. I think that damage we do is part of a cycle every intelligent species goes through on every inhabited planet, and a filter. If we don't smarten up and stop warring and destroying our environment, we won't survive. I think all our negative traits can be explained by evolution (greed, tribalism) and we need to overcome them to succeed. We are the only chance that Earth based life gets off the planet, weather it is synthetic biology, or from us seeding life elsewhere in the universe through terraforming (unless microbial life has already seeded life elsewhere). I think that everything living is made up of universe and exists within the universe, and is in a literal sense, the universe experiencing itself. A universe devoid of life is a sad thought. Therfore, more life, especially intelligent life is a good thing. Considering it took 4.6 billion years for life to evolve humans, and the sun only has about 4 billion years left (though it will prob make life on Earth impossible before then, maybe 2 billion years?), we are prob Earth based life's only chance to get out into the universe. \n\nI think nature is far more cruel than any human could be and that we have the possibility to lower the net amount of suffering in the universe. Though humans are part of nature too. One example of nature's cruelty would be cats. They kill things just for the fun of it and as far as we can tell, are incapable of empathy. By a humans standards (which it is unfair to judge a cat by), they would all be considered narcissistic psychopaths. Humans are capable of deciding to kill animals more ethically, while some animals like bears and hyenas will eat their prey while still alive and squirming. In this sense, it may even be reasonable to say humans are (one of) the only moral creature on the planet as we tend to empathize with the animals we kill and eat (at least in most cultures). Infact, we empathize with our prey so much, many humans become vegetarian by choice to lower tha amount of damage and suffering we cause (not me though).",

Keep it at full and I'll soak my panties in no time, you naughty boy. As she said that, I noticed a wet spot begin to grown in the crotch of her panties. The faster she frigged herself, the bigger the spot became. She was so close to my head, that I could smell her juices as they soaked her sexy silky panties. She was really working the vibrator on her clit and told me to watch as she was very close to losing it in her panties. She pressed the little bullet hard into now sopping panties and told me to look her in the eyes. When I looked up into her flushed face she began to cum hard in her silky panties. Her whole body shook with a tremendous force and the spot in her panties grew even bigger. She had so much juice it was running down into the crack of her ass, soaking her panties even more.

You just made Mommy squirt in her panties, bad boy. They are thoroughly soaked and waiting for your load to join the mess I just made. \"She stood and slid her silky panties down her legs. As they pulled away from her wet pussy, I could see them sticking in her obscenely swollen lips. As she dislodged them, there was so much juice from her pussy that it strung from her openness as she pushed them further down her legs. When she had them in her hand, she took the soaking crotch and pushed it into her puffy lips wiping up every bit of juice she had just released from her womaness. \"Don't want any to go to waste. \" She said with a sly smile. \"I want to make sure they cling to your swollen cock. \"She knelt by the bed next to me and lowered the crotch of her dirty wet panties over my hugely swollen member.

She wrapped them around my cock and a large pearl of pre-cum pushed its way through the wet silken material. \"Mommy's boy really must want to cum. \" She cooed at the dollop of pre-cum as it joined her already wet panties. \"Stroke it for me. Let Mommy watch you cum in her filthy dirty panties. \"I wrapped my fist around my swollen cock and began to pump furiously into her very wet panties. She reached out with her long fingernails and began to lovingly tease my overblown balls. \"Let Mommy tease that nut out of you. Let me tickle those big bloated balls till they empty into my panties. \"She leaned in closer to my panty covered cock and had her lips so close to my swollen head that she was almost touching it. She stuck her tongue out and gently swiped it across the leaking head of my penis. It was all too much for me and I grunted deep in my throat and said, \"Mommy, I'm gonna cum in your dirty wet panties. I can't hold it any longer. Your panties are so naughty and you're teasing my balls so much!\"\"Go ahead. \" She said, \"Cum in <Person>'s panties. Show me how you fill them with your hot seed. Let that big pent up load go in <Person>'s panties\"She was using both hands on my balls now and I couldn't hold back any longer. With a grunt I began to cum hard in her panties. I looked down and watched as the first blast pushed through the wet material of her silky orange panties. To my ultimate surprise, she stuck her tongue into the large blob of cum clinging to her panties and lapped at the mess I was shooting. She just kissed and licked as my load kept cumming and cumming. Mom's lips were totally covered with my seed and her dirty panties were saturated. As my shots began to dwindle down, she loving kissed the head then sat back on her haunches licking up the mess I had deposited on her luscious lips. When all evidence of my nut had been consumed by my sexy ass mom, she stood and took the panties from around my cock cleaning it up as she did so. She held them up looking at the very wet messy crotch and then, much to my amazement, stepped into them pulling them back up her sexy legs and back into place over her still wet pussy. \"Mmmm,\" she said as she pushed my cum into her soaking pussy, \"these will come in handy later when I need to cum again. I'll let you know when that is so you can watch me make them even filthier. From now on, honey, just ask me when you need to pop a nut in my dirty panties. They are yours for the asking.

He gave it a sharp tug that threw her off balance, and the platter fell clattering out of her hands and onto the floor.\n\n‘No!’\n\nHe grabbed her chin and forced her eyes onto his, lifting it.

I could feel my sphincter start to relax as well as the grease helped make their penetration of me easier. There was now a third finger joining the other two as I bit my lips so as not to cry out. He began to push and pull them in and out of me as he worked to get me ready for his cock to enter. I could feel my hole being stretched wide and I fought my reaction to get up and leave, as I needed my car. He would fuck me and then hopefully my debt would be paid. I now felt his cock head at my opening and he started to push it into my anal hole. It was starting to enter as it made its way with the help of the grease. I could hear him grunt as he pushed it deeper and deeper into me. \"Fuck you are one tight little cunt,\" he hissed. \"You never had cock in you before?\"I shock me head telling him that I was infact a virgin when it came to anal sex. There was a time that <Person> and I had discussed it but we had never tried. She was not so happy about her receiving but was happy to try a strap on for me and now here I was with the real thing deep inside me. The owner now began to fuck me pushing and pulling his cock in and out of me. His balls soon slapped my buttocks as he was in a good rhythm, attacking my virgin arse with his hard cock. He grabbed a hand full of my hair pulling my head back. \"Come on boy work with me. \"\"Fuck my cock with that cute tight hole of yours. \"I began to push back against his cock's advance both in and out of me. I was feeling myself becoming hard and my body now wanted to be fucked. He slipped his hand under me, where taking my cock in it began to stroke me long and hard. My body tensed as he pulled on my cock and fucked my arse at the same time. I was being turned on and now wanted to be fucked, as I worked with him both pushing my buttocks back and rocking myself in his hand. Oh god it felt so good as his cock poked my prostate and my cock stiffened in his hand. I wanted him and I wanted to cum inside me. I didn't care anymore as he could use me for his pleasure. His sweat dripped onto my back as he worked hard to get himself off. I gazed at the pictures on the wall and pictured myself as one of them being fucked by my new lover. I was panting and ready to shoot my load and ready for him to do the same. \"Yeah baby push that pussy back,\" he yelled. \"Work with me and we can both get off. \"\"You are one hot bitch, aint you?\"He was right. I was now his bitch and he was mating me. I could feel his rhythm intensify as he pumped me like the slut I had become. My cock was so fucking hard and I wanted to cum so bad. I was not prepared when with one last thrust he shot the first of his load into me. \"Oh fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,\" he screamed as his cock pushed deep into my bowel. He continued to pound my opening hard shooting more and more cum into meMy own cock twitched and in an instant it too exploded shooting cum onto the pillow of the bed. It kept shooting and shooting as he shot every last drop he could express into me. I screamed with pleasure as I too started to complete my orgasm as the last of both our loads now came from each of our cocks until I slumped forward onto the bed with him still inside me. I felt his cock soften and I now lay exhausted as he removed his cock from my hole. It was now at my face as he told me to lick it off. I complied with his direction and he told me that my bill had been paid. As I got up my bottom ached, as did every muscle of my body. I showered and then headed for my car, vowing never to return but also knowing that one-day I might have to again need servicing from the mechanic.",

Mrs. <Person> wants to see you in her office at eleven. \"No girl wanted to hear the words, \"Mrs. <Person> wants. \" Being 'wanted' meant being in trouble. She stalled instinctively: \"Um. . . aha, sure. What's this is about?\"\"Eleven,\" the churlish caller repeated. \"Be on time. \" She hung up. Still fighting to clear the cobwebs, <Person> hoping it was a bad dream, dropped back onto the pillow. But just as she closed her eyes, her intrusive phone unnerved her a second time. It was her mother, and her question cut <Person> to the quick: \"<Person>? Did little <Person> get on the bus? It's a school day. \"\"Oh my God—<Person>! Shit! Fuck!\" Suddenly alert, <Person> stumbled out of bed, tangling her feet in the blouse she had cast aside in the middle of the night. Kicking it away, she burst into the little girl's bedroom. There, still asleep, her daughter, her precious child. It was nine-thirty. In tears, the harried mom leaned back against the wall, her head thumping hard. By the time the child was up and off to school, she had missed half of the day's instruction. Things had not started well. It was about to get worse. LATER THAT MORNING:'Never,' <Person> silently lectured herself; 'never has anyone pushed me around this way. The bitch has some nerve! I should walk out—quit!'\"I hope you are you listening, young lady?\" Frozen in place, the shocked <Person> knew her boss held all the cards. \"I will not, do you hear me? I will not tolerate problem girls here at <Organization>. \"Normally unflappable, the madam's words were a warning. \"That stunt you pulled last night is unacceptable—and you know it. What's more, you did it with one of our regulars! Now he's gone off and registered angry reviews on a dozen websites! Look!\"<Person> shoved a stack of loose papers under the jittery prostitute's nose. \"Read them,\" she ordered. <Person>'s tired eyes silently skimmed what she already knew. \"Out loud,\" <Person> demanded. With a hesitant nod, <Person> recited the details of the client's indictment: \"Vixens,\" The self-styled 'Superlative Escort Service' in New York is not what it seems. Yes, it charges the most. But the girls don't deliver. Example: Liss**** is a pricy letdown! Yes, she's beautiful. Though advertised as a 'Total Package Escort Companion', she gives the impression she has a train to catch and the 'ending' - the part that counts? SHE SKIPS IT! At those prices, a guy shouldn't get the bum's rush! Bottom line: Screw Vixens!\" <Person> K*****<Person> tried to make her case, but the exacting madam cut her off. \"<Person>, he. . . \"\". . . mouth shut!\" <Person> insisted. \"These days, everybody checks the reviews! I should fire you, but you happen to have the prettiest eyes in New York. You're educated, cultured; I need girls like you. You cleared a ton of money your first week, so it's obvious you make the big spenders like you—at least when the mood strikes!\"\"I'm sorry, <Person>, but. . . \"\"'. . . sorry' doesn't cut it, girl. He paid extra for you, and you had an obligation to see he was satisfied. \"But <Person>,\" <Person> stammered on, \"Some guys expect. . . \"\". . . too much? TOO MUCH?\" Standing abruptly, the savvy madam snapped back at her. \"This isn't Escort 101, <Person>. It's the big leagues. You're a thousand-dollar-an-hour girl. Get a grip! I'm giving you one day—one—this one, to prove yourself! Handle it! It's what I pay you for. Am I crystal clear?\"Not knowing how to get out of the mess and desperately needing tuition money for <Person>'s private school, <Person> had no choice. \"Yes, ma'am,\" she abjectly yielded. The room turned quiet as <Person> crossed her arms over her breasts. \"I'm assigning you a triple. \"<Person> blanched",

    "prompt": "Thank you for your thoughtful comment. \n\nI am sorry for the suffering you have experienced in life that you alluded to. The reason I brought up that rape and rapists are more common than we would like to admit, is to emphasis that this is a common experience and we are not the only ones. I agree with you that the guy whose picture you linked does look like a normal guy.\n\nWhen I wrote that it's a common experience, my thoughts were in the place of \"maybe it's just water under the bridge and I should forgive him and reach out since everyone makes mistakes.\" I don't think I can do that though. At least not now. If he was to sincerely apologize, I would consider it, but apologizing is admitting guilt. I did report the incident to the police, so I don't imagine he will admit guilt any time soon.\n\nChild support is something that I have needed, but did not go for because the law has no protections for women whose child was conceived by rape. First, a rape conviction is rare, and even if there is a conviction, a judge will always listen to a request from a father who wants to spend time with his kid. Going for child support opens the door to visitation and eventually has the potential for custody battles. Additionally he is self employed and would be able to lie about his income.",

    "prompt": "sses that grow near the river mouth, under my feet. It was a struggle to get out of the water, while dragging 3 feet of chain. This was the Albanian coast, and quite hot at this time of year, so the fading light meant bugs!The gloom made it easier to stay unseen, while I looked for clothes. A child's swimsuit was left out to dry. Lucky it was a string bikini, or it would not have fit at all, but as it was, it made me look like a beach bunny, looking for a hookup. The top covered little more than my areolas, while the bottom became a thong when it was stretched to comer my hips. The next house had a dish towel, so I made a bit of a skirt, to gain some modesty. I did not trust the law enforcement in this area, so I could not just call for help. First, I needed to get the bolt out of the chain and cuffs on my wrists, and I had to pick a cheep lock on the shackles that held my wrists. The bolt proved the easiest. I hammered it with the base of a screw driver that I found on a patio set. It must have been hand tight, but it was a stronger hand than mine!An old wreck of a delivery truck gave me some light wire, and a private place to work on opening the handcuffs. The sun had set, when I staggered out to the highway. It was dark enough, that I had to walk about a mile, in bare feet, to a light at the corner, where the coastal access road met the coastal highway. Standing in the week light, I waited for a ride. Two guys in an old truck, decided that I was worth the risk, and pulled over for me. My outfit screamed hooker, and they couldn't understand a word I said. They kept indicating to their sleeping cabin, and nothing I did would persuade them to just let me have a ride. I got lucky having at least found truckers that use condoms! Self lubricating was smart too. I got into the cab with the older guy. He probably owned the truck, or just had seniority. He nervously took my little swim suit and dish towel off of me and sent his hands all over his new found treasure. He knew he had lots of time. I didn't expect my nipples to be that sensitive when he started lightly nibbling on one. The other one was being rolled, by a guy that was three times my age, and he was starting to turn my crank!At least I was safe, and warm. \"Vodka?\" I asked, after he blasted into my pussy. \"Vodka?\" I persisted, expecting them to know that one word of English. The old fucker pulled a jar out of a cubby hole, and handed it to me. I took a sniff, then a sip, then a couple of gulps as I felt the warmth spread through my aching body. The old guy was getting his strength back already. He probably hadn't enjoyed a woman in quite some time, so I took another big hit, and pressed back into him, hoping that I could relax, and maybe fall asleep as he worked me from behind. A few hours later I felt the big rig coming to a stop, and the other driver was anxious to have his turn in the fucking berth. This young guy was also fast. There would be no sleeping while he fucked me. His 6 inches was an easy accommodation for me, at any hole, but this guy loved it in missionary only. If his breath had been less toxic, it could have been a good time for all, but that was not the case. After he started pawing me, for the third time, I had to take him into my own hands. I pushed my way down to his penis and practically swallowed his cock. It was like I pushed a button on his back that jerked him into the full prone position, with arms at his sides. Now I saw that I could jump on top, and perhaps stay up high, riding him, but not having to smell his acrid breath. He reached up and squeezed my breasts while I raised and lowered myself on his modest tool. It took about 15 minutes but he squeezed another one into me, so I went down on him, hoping to finish him off for the night. I was just mechanically doing the work, while his breathing went from hard to grunting, and another dribble was added to his account, but he was done. He let me sleep for another hour or maybe two, but I woke to the feel of a penis entering my pussy. We pulled into a small restaurant right around first light, and I was offered breakfast in exchange for a round of oral. Well, cum was not an appetizer, but I was starved, and I knew these cocks fairly well by now, so why not. I did get pancakes for the trouble though. We had Athens ahead, and I could get to the American consulate there, so I just stayed with my new friends, all of the way. They pulled up, in front of the Security station, at the end of Embassy <Address>. When they helped me out of the rig, they handed me some currency, and kissed me like a loved one. The detail at the gate had to call in my name and photo, since I had no identification. They had a female come down from the Embassy, to do a strip search, but it seemed ridiculous to both of us, as I removed the garments. She took note of the bruising and swelling of my genitals and nipples, but I told her that it was just a misadventure, and I needed to get home. She nodded in understanding, and led me to the second building, which was the <Organization> Consulate. Just another weekend adventure.",

We push it around on our tongues, trying not to squish and spread what's left on me.\n\n\"Thanks for sharing,\" I smile as he goes down for another slurp and we take our time savoring our loads. He finally collapses next to me, and we look at each other with exhausted satisfaction. I run my hand over his abs, up his ribs and finally run my finger over his chest. \"There's something I wanna ask you.\"\n\n\"Yes, our cum tastes great together,\" he smiles.\n\n\"I know, but –\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll marry you.\"\n\n\"Yes–\"\n\n\"Yes, I love you more than ever.\"\n\n\"I love you, too, but–\"\n\n\"Yes, you can smell my socks.\" With that, I jump on top of him and cover his mouth with my hand.

After another hot kiss, I finally compose myself.\n\n\"ANYWAY, I was thinkin...\" I rub my finger over his pecs again. \"You know I really love you, and there's nowhere I would rather be than right here.

So was the male police officer standing on my right. There were two other people in the room. Lawyers I assumed. I scanned the lineup of eight men. All had brown, thick hair except for the one at the end who’s hair was thinning. I sighed. Being a witness was a hassle. I took a long lunch at work and went straight here. The police station. On Friday, as I was leaving a bar, I cut through an alley. A shortcut. I saw a few rats scurry and then I saw a woman, unconscious, on the ground and a man hovering over her with his penis out. The woman had blonde hair but it was matted and dark in areas. I assumed it was blood. I didn’t scream except I did sharply intake air and this prompted the man to look up. Less than a second. Then he ran. I called the police and stayed with the woman. I told the police what I saw and they pressed for a description of the man. Brown, thick hair. Sharp chin. Firm jaw. Black t-shirt. Vaguely heavy. Vaguely good looking. Vaguely…\n\nTo be honest I wasn’t sure what I saw. It was dark. It was too quick. But the police officers pressed. And pressed. And pressed. Yes. Yes. I saw him clearly. And then I reconsidered. I didn’t see too clearly. The woman died at the hospital. The police officers pressed me some more.\n\n“We have a suspect,” said the female police officer. “We need you to do a lineup.”",

In doubt, I would get rid of both. Syiah who using religion to dominate more territories.. the war now,between <Person> and Sunnis is Zionist and ,America games.All strong Muslims countries who have been an enemy to Israel must annihilated ….so Zionist planned to destroy Iraq Saddam Sunni and Iran.The two really a strong enemies to Israeil.After destroyed Sunni glory in Iraq ,Zionist created new Syiah regime in order to destroy Iran.How ? By Planted Syiah uprising.Sonce Syiah is a minority,Sunni will unite and win and massacred <Person>..then Iran will intervene to protect their Syiah bothers…and Sunni will annihilated Iran ….on behalf of <Organization> if Iran clearly intervene in Yemen or Iraq Zionist games will be completed.I guess most Arabs and <Person> not believe the games.They even not acknowledge the game.Before Jews playing death game by crushing America wtc and blame <Person>.and blame and accuse <Person> have wmd.Zionist jews planted war between Western Christian force and Muslims countries…that,s why America destroy Iraq saddam and Israel will save..at the same times Zionist planted sectarian at the area and Israel will save forever when Saudi and Sunnis coalition will destroy iran.The game drafted in White House before 9 11.,, The wars in Middle East now is really Zionist games..and 9 11 created by Zionist in order to destroy all strong enemies to Israel.America now is in the hand of Zionist Jews bankers..and America will lead Western Christian countries to fight and die for Jews and israel..but many said Muslims is brutal and killing each others.Western people not acknowledge that Syiah is not islam..All sunnis regard Syiah is non Mulsims..So it is war between non muslims and muslims..likely when America engage in war on Iraq <Person>..it is a war between Christians..non Muslims with muslims..Sunnis Muslims Iraqis.Zionist who planted the game and lured Christian to destroy Sunnis Iraqis <Person>..then Zionist lured Syiah to kill sunnis ..force Sunnis to killed <Person>..including annihilate iran..how smart Zionist was..they fooled Christian ,Syiah and Sunnis to destroying each others.Anyways .Christians can,t be destroyed by Zionist games..since they are strong..even it,s also killed thousands of Whites.Sunnis and Syiah who are suffer by this dirty games that supported by Christians Whites Zionist in America and others Western Christians,who are converted to Zionism.Christians is not a strong religion to prevent western people to convert to Zionist.Most of them bribed by Zionist Jews to do dirty games on behalf of Israel ,Jews and Zionist.Zionist also planted bad moral on Christians..and turned to nonreligious people.Jews also planted bad moral in <Person> and <Person> long a go in order to destroy morality and to destroy human kind.Some sunnis countries also lured by Zionist to kill their Sunnis brothers.Are these game really make Israel safe?.No.Their games will unite Sunnis in future..and the game will turn to an upset..in very near future.Zionist last game will divided people in two..Non Zionist force and Zionist force.Of course <Person> is leading the war on Zionist..Likely to the past Zionist always created strong force to them.Jews already digging their grave.I feel so sorry for Western Whites zionist, who are eventually fooled by Zionist Jews and lured them to die for Jews and engage a fool war on Muslims only to save millions of greedy and weird Jews in Israel.",

    "prompt": "It was a long day at the office. I took the long drive back to Long Island from Manhattan, from my job as an interior designer for a private company. As a 40 year-old African-American female, it wasn't easy getting this position and status, I've certainly worked hard enough for it and now I'm indulging myself of everything I feel I deserve after all these years. I made the grueling trip and finally reach my town Babylon, N. Y, I drove straight for the mall just ten minutes away from my home. I got out of my car, locked the car doors and proceeded to the mall entrance, from the mall parking lot. Since summer was approaching I needed some cook wear and utensils, so I made my way to the basement of the department store. Spent nearly an hour searching for exactly what I wanted and stood on line and paid for my new items. I had enough of shopping and was ready to go home and as I approached my vehicle I got a strange feeling but quickly shook it off. I got in the car and looked at my rear view mirror when I was staring at a black male I tried to run but the stranger put a knife to my throat and told me to drive. I drove for what seemed like forever, but it was more like an hour. When we approached an off road, I was told to follow the road and I complied, when we reach the end of the road there was a cabin, I was ordered to exit the car and was told that no one was around so screaming would be useless. We got out and entered the cabin. The cabin was fully equipped and seemed like this man took some serious planning in this abduction. He told me to sit down and pointed to a chair, I sat and kept quiet. The tall man, black about thirty-five, 6' 5\" and about 240 lbs. asked what my name was, I said, <Person>. He said hello and not to worry that he wasn’t going to hurt me just to relax and listen to what I was told. I said okay. He then led me to a bedroom where he told me to undress and lay on the bed. I did as I was asked to do. I was then handcuffed to the headboard and footboard, hands and legs. I asked that he” please don’t do this” He answered saying that it was necessary and that he had to go out to run an errand. I was then left alone and fell asleep and when I awoke it was night. My husband I know must be frantic with worry. I prayed that I made it out of this so that I would see my family again. The man returned and was making a lot of noise outside the bedroom. When finally the doorknob turn slowly and I watched in horror, not knowing what was going to happen next. The man then un-cuffed me and told me to shower and directed to a well kept bathroom with all the essentials. When I finished he had laid out clothing for me or should I say lingerie, he told me to put it on, It was a black laced teddy with matching thongs. ” I dressed in the teddy”. The man then introduced himself, calling himself <Person>. He told me that I reminded him of his deceased wife and that he knew my pattern and had been following me for weeks. He told me he wanted to make love to me and then he would decide whether to let me go. After he was done with me, but it all depended on my cooperation, if I gave myself to him completely. I asked what exactly did he expect from me and he answered,” follow my lead and submit to me” and then he said” obey my every whim” that last statement made me shutter in fright, and I had no idea what to expect. This man was sick, but I knew I had to survive for my family so I began to prepare myself for the inevitable. <Person> was quite charming though, making dinner for us and setting the table by candlelight, there were flowers and crystal and music, champagne as well. I was told to eat up, I think the food was take out though but it was good, consisted of roasted chicken, roasted potatoes and carrots and asparagus. ” After dinner <Person> poured champagne”… and poured mine in a large goblet and told me to drink all of it. He cuffed me to the chair where I was sitting and told me he would be back. I heard the shower going and quickly looked around the room for an escape, but it was no use I was cuffed and he had the key. I quickly gave up the idea. <Person> was back in about fifteen minutes he was naked and sat on a nearby couch, looking at me a rubbing his member. He was a very dark man With long, thick cock, and I wondered if it would hurt me. I tried not to look at him but he told me to look at him and don’t look away, I thought this is really sick. But I figured I’d better listen to this” ravening lunatic",

    "prompt": "A quarter of a century ago, a small crack appeared on the facade of the Evil Empire, a crack that over the following years widened, despite some desperate efforts to plaster it over, and eventually became a giant fissure that brought the whole edifice down.\n\nIronically, it was one man's jump over a wall that nine years later led to the Wall coming down. On 14 August 1980, the discontent among the workers in shipyards of Gdansk, on the Polish Baltic coast, finally boiled over and a strike action commenced. A young electrician, who had been fired by the management for his political activity, has heard about the strike and climbed over the wall of the shipyard to join his friends and colleagues - and to quickly become their leader. His name was <Person>, and the rest is history - or, as <Person> would say - the end of history.\n\n(here are some\n\n, courtesy of <Organization>, via\n\n)\n\nI was only eight at the time, but I remember that my family had cut short out holiday by the sea when things started heating up in Gdansk. Everyone was fearing the repeat of 1970, when striking shipyard workers were suppressed with much bloodshed by the communist security forces. It didn't quite turn out that way - thank God - and even the martial law a year and a half later proved not to be particularly violent. The long revolution, which culminated in the events of 1989, was relatively bloodless by history's standards. Whatever the injustice of the communist oppression, Poles - and others - never resorted to blowing themselves, and others, up to press their political point. Yet, in the end, the victory was ours.\n\nIt's a sign of the times - and a closure of sorts - that <Person>, the wall jumper, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and one of the best known icons of the end of the twentieth century, has just announced that after the celebrations of the twenty fifth anniversary of the Polish August are over, he will be quitting \"Solidarity\". <Person> says that \"his\" \"Solidarity\" was a social movement, and now it has become simply a trade union run by a new generation of professional organizers (\n\nin Polish).\n\nGood, I'm thinking. There is no better testament to the overwhelming success of \"<Organization>\" that it can now be just a \"normal\" trade union.\n\nMore blogging on this topic later on in the month.->",

    "prompt": "in a way that I could use it to suck on her clit. This drove her crazy as she squirmed and moaned with pleasure. I continued to suck her clitoris while I inserted a couple of fingers into her dripping wet pussy. She went nuts as I slid my long fingers in and out of her while my tongue bathed her clit. She kept calling out my name and was really pulling my hair, I could tell by the way she was grinding her pussy into my face that she was getting close. Her gasps confirmed that as her breathing became very heavy and she was moaning and groaning. I was really working my tongue on her when she started letting out those really high pitched shrieks. I felt her body start to quiver as she pushed her pussy up into my face and began to orgasm. I could feel her juices flowing and I lapped up every drop I could. When she reached her climax she pushed my face away as her body writhed in ecstasy on the bed. I wanted to continue to eat her but she wouldn't let me. After a couple of minutes her climax ended and my dick was rock hard. She saw this and told me that she wanted me to fuck her with that big dick of mine. I climbed on top of her and slid the length of my dick back and forth over her wet pussy lips. She didn't want to have anything to do with my teasing her and she reached down, grabbed my cock and placed the head right against her pussy and thrust her hips upward, at the same time I pushed down into her and she let out a scream. \"Oh Shit\" she said, \"that feels so good baby, fuck me hard\". Being the loving nephew that I was I was more than happy to oblige my favorite aunt. I lifted the weight of my upper body onto my hands so I had leverage so I could fuck her nice and hard like she wanted. She lifted her legs up into the air so her pussy was completely exposed to me and I fucked her with really long and hard strokes. I still remember the slapping sounds we were making as our bodies collided with one another. I was really enjoying this but I had another position in mind. She had such a beautiful ass I wanted to fuck her from behind. I slid my cock out of her and told her to get on her hands and knees. She must have been reading my mind because in no time she was ready and waiting for me. She looked so good as she had her back arched, face in the pillow and her perfect ass up in the air. I positioned myself behind her and placed my hands on her hips as I slid the full length of my dick inside her eager pussy. I felt her pushing back on me as I started sliding in and out of her. We started to fuck with a real passion as she met every one of my thrusts with one of her own. The sight of her ass jiggling each time our bodies connected was something to behold. It turned me on so much I fucked her that much harder. I reached down and grabbed a handful of hair and used it to pull her back onto me. This made her back arch so much more than it already was, it was perfect. I wish I had a camcorder rolling because this would have been as good as any porno I've seen. Our bodies bucked as we started to fuck even harder. I grabbed her by both ass cheeks and squeezed her exquisite cheeks with my big hands. I took my right hand and started spanking her on her left ass cheek. This really turned her on because she got even more vocal when I did it. So I spanked her even harder. It was something, seeing her milky white ass turn beet red. I started to get that feeling in my balls so I started to slow down a little in order to try and make this last as long as I could, but she wanted none of that. She told me to keep fucking her, she said \"I want you to cum deep inside me baby. \" I could hear her breath quicken as she started panting and I kept fucking her hot pussy as hard as I could. It became almost frenetic as I was on the verge of coming. \"I'm about to cum Aunt <Person>. \" She said \"Go ahead baby\" as I let loose shooting my load into her. The feeling of my cum inside of her must have set her off because she came just after I did. I had never made love to a woman the way we just did. After we both came I just laid on top of her for a little while. I was completely amazed that I had just fucked my Aunt <Person> here in her own bed. Anyway, common sense got the better of us both as we realized that we had better not lay there much longer so we washed up a straightened ourselves up so that no one would suspect anything when they got home. This began a 2 year affair between us that ended when I went away to college but was recently rekindled a few years ago at a family function.",

This publication urged countries around the world to treat DV as a criminal act, stated that the right to a private family life does not include the right to abuse family members, and acknowledged that, at the time of its writing, most legal systems considered DV to be largely outside the scope of the law, describing the situation at that time as follows: \"Physical discipline of children is allowed and, indeed, encouraged in many legal systems and a large number of countries allow moderate physical chastisement of a wife or, if they do not do so now, have done so within the last 100 years.

Below, you will find some of the crucial advantages that airsoft offers to its players which makes it a much more popular option compared to paintball.\n\n1. The real look of the airsoft of the weapon\n\nWhen it comes to the crucial difference between the airsoft and the paintball, we must highlight the weapon selection. In the airsoft, the weapon looks like a real gun. This goes to the point that airsoft weapons need to have a special 6mm orange pointer at the end in order to be recognized as a weapon made for the airsoft.\n\nMany things give the confusion and make the appearance of the airsoft guns so similar to the real ones, including the equipment, design, strength, and potential. If you are interested, you can check <URL> and see a big selection of various airsoft weapons. If you plan to start with airsoft activity, you should find the propel weapon for you. When you are choosing, you need to search very well for the one that will suit your needs, and that’s the reason why a wide range of options is so beneficial.\n\n2. The precision of the airsoft gun shooting\n\nWhen it comes to the airsoft bbs, they are much smaller than paintball pellets which means they are more resistant to the wind. As a result, their precision is better. Despite that, if you already played paintball, you probably noticed how big paintball pellets are.\n\nMore precisely, you can see them flying towards you, so you have time to hide and avoid them. On the other hand, airsoft bbs are so small, which means they are not noticeable. This is one more thing that influences the precision of airsoft guns. In other words, the hit percent is a lot bigger in this case.\n\n3. Airsoft gives you a feeling that you are in a real battle\n\nOne",

It’s been an awesome year writing for you guys, with lots of fun reviews and fun side content just for you! I think this calls for a bit of a celebration! So brace yourselves, as we’re going to take a look at a new game that came out over the holiday season every week for the rest of the month, plus one or two pieces of side content just to top it off! But enough of me blathering on, let’s get to the real reason why you guys are here: the review. For the first week I want to take a look at Saints Row: The Third, the latest and almost certainly silliest entry into the franchise. It’s kind of hilarious how a game with a mature rating can have so much unabashedly childish humor in it. From the preposterous dildo sword weapon to the Tank Skydiving mission ala The A-Team (the movie, not the show), everything about this game is totally over the top and ridiculous, to the point where I’ve heard many critics complain about how absurd it is, saying that the game is a step backwards from its predecessor. And you know what, in a cynical sort of way, they’re right. Whereas Saints Row 2 felt more like a different take on the Grand Theft Auto games, The Third lacks their emotional depth, trading out meaningful character relationships for cheap gags and over the top stunts.",

Strong independent women really want control, and are very selfish, greedy, spoiled, money hungry, and very picky as well. They will only want the very best of all and will never settle or less.

    "prompt": "Frankly, speaking as a feminist, I'm mostly in agreement with you. Reproductive rights are important across the board, and men should have a fair deal of choice when it comes to it.\n\nHowever, I still want to introduce some nuance here.\n\n* There's a pragmatic concern here related to the welfare of the child. We don't want mothers and children living in poverty, and that has historically been a widespread problem that carries other social ills. Child support was invented as a measure not to say \"punish\" men, but rather to ensure that children were at least fed, clothed, housed and educated to prevent the suffering and social problems associated to lacking these things in early childhood. \n\n* As a corollary, I would require the introduction of robust child welfare programs to guarantee that, absent child support, the child will still have chances to do well and the mother won't fall into poverty. This includes things like free childcare programs, food assistance, and programs not unlike the Finnish baby boxes. I would still make these available to couples raising children together, though.\n\n* Like you said, it is important that all parental rights be abdicated in cases that the father wishes to abstain from child support. It is also important that the father be \"duly notified\" of the pregnancy. I think the mother would have to demonstrate clear attempts to contact and notify the father within some specified timeframe. \n\n* Like you also kind of said, in many ways, raising a child is more onerous than a pay cut, in that it involves a lot of unpaid, thankless labor. This in itself creates an asymmetrical relationship between the burdens placed on each parent, and this in turn has to be considered when trying cases related to \"financial abportion\". This is why forcing women to \"take responsibility\" for an accident is placing a much greater burden on them than child support would be. <Person> broadly, I agree with you that options for men should exist, but you are obscuring the asymmetrical nature of the issue.\n\n&gt; anyways, the new stream for lot of these thots is to get pregnant from a rich guy and then use the baby to make money.\n\n* While I'm not going to deny that this may happen, I think this narrative is likely over-inflated by confirmationa dn salience bias. I would question what exactly is the prevalence of this, especially considering most young women aren't even on onlyfans and (even though women are more likely to date older men) [most young women date men of their own age.](<URL>\n\n&gt;Pls Don't look at it from ur perspective of morality because morality is entirely subjective and to u abortions might be moral\n\n* This is very silly. Morality is subjective, but that doesn't mean literally anything goes, or that we can't have valid points to make about it. You clearly are already looking at it from a moral perspective when you said something is \"fair\" or \"unfair\". You are being very shoddy.",

    "prompt": "Rather than accepting that 200k is fucking insane for an ex council house, and accepting that everyone who had their nose in the trough must now pay the price for their participation in the housing ponzi scheme… we have apparently decided to prop it up still further and increase people’s ability to get into debt that they will never be able to clear. Just last night I was porking this skank, and she told me that ten years ago she only owed £5,000 mortgage on her house, today she owes £75,000 ON THE SAME MOTHER-FUCKING HOUSE and can’t afford the fucking internet, only in her case she got divorced and her “loser” ex-husband got 30% of the house value as settlement… yaaay, but the fact is it is usually the other way around, it is usually the “loser” ex-husband who gets none of the asset value and still gets loaded with the debt. If you exclude the fact that this skank got skinned by her ex, her story is quite normal, this City is full of skanks who divorced men having paid off half the mortgage, stiff the ex-husband with the repayments by way of alimony and child support, and then go out and get second and third mortgages up to 110% of the “value” of the place at the peak of the housing bubble. Yes folks, this is the unspoken truth about the UK housing bubble, most of this soon to be negative equity property is occupied by women, who have been busy re-mortgaging to use the place as an ATM, and so a house price crash will disproportionately affect the wimminz… let’s face it, a single guy can be as happy as anything in a 1 bedroom place, but UK housing stock contains almost no 1 bedroom places, the vast majority is 2 or 3 bedroom, largely occupied by <Person> and the ex-children of men, and sometimes their new live in lover. So, what’s the catch / point? While negative equity can be an enormous problem for a man, he is after all working and can come to some sort of financial arrangement with the bank, even it it means selling the new car and buying a clunker and cutting his expenses for a few years. Put a wimminz in negative equity and it isn’t an enormous problem, it is game over, the bitch can’t earn any money except by divorcing a man and ransoming his kids, so there is no further economies to be made and no future income to be used to pay down the burden, besides which the wimmins are only interested in more free house-as-an-ATM money for more ponies. So a housing price crash represents not just the financial pigeons coming home to roost, but doing so to two different classes of society, the wimmins, who have most of the houses, and are absolutely not prepared to downgrade or downsize or make any economies of any kind whatsoever, and the men, who are just as likely to say fuck it, quit work, declare themselves bankrupt, and sign on the dole. If that happens then the <Organization> collapses financially, and ALL the wimminz entitlement programs come crashing down, and nobody in government today or recently will get re-elected, either by the wimminz or the men. The fact is that the financial situation that the UK is in is so serious that there is no way of avoiding the pain, and every attempt to delay addressing the issue and facing the pain, and most importantly making those who were most irresponsible suffer the greatest losses, is simply going to make the final reckoning even more painful. And of course, any rebuilding of society and reduction of debt can only be achieved via men and their production of work and value, so these delays not only unfairly distribute most of the pain to those who were not irresponsible in the first place, the men (who did not want a new fucking kitchen every three fucking years, not as though the bitch could boil an egg anyway) but also delaying and therefore maximising that pain for the not irresponsible men, while yet again protecting the fucking wimminz, who will be whining that it ain’t for them, it is for their childruuuun…\n\nInteresting times ahead for sure, and painful, but not as painful for me as the wimminz, no sireee… bring it on.",

    "prompt": "I think you are misunderstanding why people focus on the violence perpetuated by the West. I say all this recognizing that the 'West' is a faulty, reductionist term. \n\nFirst, Western countries are richer and more powerful than other countries. Because of the industrial revolution, the West had an unparalleled military advantage which allowed them to colonize the world whether through direct empire or informal empire. \n\nSecond, colonization and its effects are directly relevant to what is happening right now. The age of colonialism only ended less than 100 years ago, that is EXTREMELY recent. To solve modern problems we have to focus on understanding the causes. If you think that the effects of colonialism will dissipate within 100 years you have a decently bad sense of historical perspective. \n\nThird, the very fact that people criticize the West more is indicative that they are more open and democratic, more able to own up to their mistakes. People who criticize the legacy of imperialism of the West are, in my view, those who ACTUALLY want to make their countries better and more humane. The apologists, I think, are the ones who feel guilty and have projected too much of their identity upon their nation.\n\nFourth, there is a selection bias. Americans care about criticizing America. Europeans criticize Europe. It makes absolute sense for Westerners to criticize their countries and their history and because of the spread of Western culture abroad, it makes absolute sense that the world will be more aware about the history and politics of the West , particularly the US.\n\nThe overfocus on the crimes of the West makes sense because Western countries are the richest and most powerful, they have the most educated citizens. You used examples about the Ottoman Empire and the Mongols. And yes, EVERYONE, including leftists and 'woke' people recognize that the world was way more violent than it is right now. We are better now. We don't accept the use of violence anymore the way we used to. All of this is good. It means we are moving forward and we are becoming more humane and we are becoming more critical of the horrible history we have inherited. My problem with your argument is that it implies that because we are better now, we should like just stop our critiques but no! We have to continues because that is the only way to make the world better. Don't settle only because we are better than the past because that is a very low bar. Two centuries from now, people will look back on us and think we were absolutely backwards and barbaric. That's how progress works.",

    "prompt": "After reviewing specifications, speaking with an independent electrical engineer, and conducting a life cycle cost analysis, we selected a 28 watt bulb with extremely low mercury content. The 28 watt bulb was more expensive than the 32 watt bulb, and we were initially concerned about reduced light levels that might be associated with lower watts. However, we were pleased to learn that the 28 watt bulb had better performance characteristics than our standard 32 watt bulb and that light level expectations should be very comparable. We were also pleased to learn that the 28 watt bulb we selected had one of the lowest mercury levels in the industry and longer expected service life than the 32 watt bulbs being replaced. It’s beyond the scope of this column to discuss mercury’s role in fluorescent lighting and its environmental implications. For a comprehensive review of fluorescent lighting technology, see the following Wikipedia entry:<URL> [Or read the <Organization> article, “Why Recycle Used Bulbs?” by <Person>, August 2007, page 18.] A reduction of four watts per bulb (12%) might seem like a minor efficiency improvement, but lighting represents a significant percentage of an office building’s electrical consumption. It’s also important to recognize the double benefit associated with lighting improvements, since reductions in lighting energy decrease the cooling load on HVAC systems. Using our average electricity cost (in cents per kWh), we became convinced the energy savings and longer life associated with 28 watt bulbs would justify the cost premium (compared to the 32 watt bulb); we also calculated that the electricity savings over the life of the new bulbs would actually pay for the entire cost of re-lamping (including labor and bulb recycling fees). In other words, this was a project that would conserve energy while completely paying for itself over the life of the new lamps. The cost analysis didn’t even include HVAC savings or productivity improvements for our staff (who won’t be replacing so many burned out bulbs each week). At this point, you might be wondering why we went for the field goal (with a 28 watt bulb) instead of the touchdown (the 25 watt bulb). Did you really expect an October FM Frequency column without a football analogy?",

A 2015 study using rosehip powder suggests that rosehips offer several anti-aging properties, including the ability to keep skin moisturized. Researchers found that participants who took rosehip powder orally experienced noticeable improvements in the overall moisture of their skin. You may also receive these benefits by applying rosehip oil topically. Rosehip oil is a dry, or nongreasy, oil. This makes it a great natural moisturizer for all skin types. 3. It helps exfoliate and helps brightens skin\n\n\n\nNatural exfoliation with rosehip oil can help reduce dullness and leave you with glowing, vibrant skin.

Thankfully, he knew more than one way to make a whore scream. Unceremoniously, he pushed two fingers up her completely dry and unwilling snatch, probing her, filling her.\n\n“Nnnn! Stppp!” <Person> cried and yanked her body forward, trying to escape.\n\nThe man only responded by reaching forward and grabbing her long, dangling hair, yanking her head backwards by it like reins. “Listen bitch!” he started, still pumping his fingers in the girl’s pussy, listening to her sobs and whimpers. “I’m gonna fuck you now. Everyone here is gonna fuck you. And if you know what is good for you, your gonna keep those panties of yours in your fucking mouth… understand? You fuck it up, I swear I’m not going to stop whipping you until every single inch of your skin is red.” He punched the inside of her tender cunt, and let go of her hair “You hear me?”\n\n�",

They had been successful horse breeders for some time already, but now they moved to apply their horse breeding and bison management skills to the new imported breeds of cattle. As a result, many of the earliest cattle and/or horse herds in north america belonged to First Nations and Métis, and some of the original canadian herds were brought north by skilled cattle drivers from those same groups. In many ways, the great north-south cattle drives represented the last uses of the original major Indigenous trade networks of the americas at the time, which did indeed run from the far north to the far south. The archetypal \"cowboy shirt\" and leather chaps were both developed from traditional Indigenous gear, tufted war shirts and leggings respectively. This is easy to accept in the case of chaps, but for those feeling doubtful about the shirts, consider the fact that \"cowboy shirts\" today, like most button down dress shirts, have a rounded bottom edges on the front and back, and a distinct v-cut at the sides, usually rounded. None of that is about the shape of the wearer's hips or tucking the shirts in. These cuts and hems reflect the shape of the hide of a four legged animal, and how teh stronger, thicker portions are arranged to sit where the most wear happens. In the southern plains and southwest of the rockies especially, <Organization> Nations opted to ranch rather than farm. While it is true that the resulting way of life may have seemed more familiar, the choice was an eminently practical one. They understood the nature of the prairie drought cycles and the prairie soil, and could not afford fancy eastern farm machinery which might have allowed them to work the land in defiance of the environmental conditions. First Nations were also prevented from retaining access to water to irrigate crops courtesy of an invidious settler designed licensing system and continuous enclosure and taking of reserved lands.

This is all part of the larger game. You make the mistake of thinking that we go through periods loving the jews. This is false. I’ve never in my entire life loved jews, but I do admit that I treated them with a double standard. I was very sympathetic because of the holocaust and this was due to programming. When I began to have independent (and critical) thoughts about everything, I eventually saw through the bs. The holocaust being a massive bs story obviously. And although you jews like to say we are “full of hate” I do not think “hate” (your definition) describes the emotions which I feel now that I know the truth. Perhaps it’s because most jews, especially Ashkenazi jews, are genetically predisposed toward psychopathy? I know that’s the case and I know that’s largely what the problem is. You jews may think you’re the chosen people and can do no wrong and cannot be criticized (because you are chosen and also because of demanding victim status over the holohoax). You may think that us “gentiles” want drugs, prostitutes, porn, and material things which target base animal instincts and that you jews provide it to us.

We have also trademarked our names and logos. My goal is to protect the look and feel and other elements that make the dining experience at A16 and SPQR unique so that others cannot trade on our goodwill.”\n\nWhile I was wondering what possibility any restaurateur may have of enforcing this, a chance encounter led me to <Person>, A16’s commercial lawyer and, subsequently, to a meeting in the offices of his law firm, <<Organization>>, in San Francisco’s business district. Ironically, for someone handling the modern face of restaurants, <Person>’s office is located directly opposite Tadich Grill which, having opened in 1849 claims, with some justification, to be the oldest restaurant in California.\n\n<Person> is also an intellectual property lawyer with several restaurant clients who specialises in what he describes as ‘soft’ intellectual property i.e. trademarks rather than patents. He confirmed that this line is meant to convey to the world that <<Organization>> considers its menu protectable property and is forewarning everyone that it will do its utmost to protect that intellectual property.\n\nAnd, like a good lawyer, he backed this up. Two cases from recent American law which had upheld copyright in a menu. The first, in New York, upheld the copyright protection in the overall design of Chinese menus in which photographs of the dishes appeared while the second in Kansas between the buyers of a Mexican restaurateur who had subsequently sued the daughter of the vendors after she had opened a competing restaurant and violated copyright in the order in which certain items were listed. The expression ‘three beef tacos’ could not be protected but a fanciful description that incorporated this dish could.\n\n<Person>, perhaps not surprisingly, believes that this can only be beneficial to chefs and restaurateurs. “The touchstone is",

No, because it's German-ness taken to an exaggerated degree, that cultures cannot be mixed without severe damage to a nation state (the idea that it would be impossible to be both or require complete subjugation to *all* values of a particular culture).

The outcome is of Jews emigrating to Israel, considered a \"nationalist\" country, to many (of the Left). And \"Zionist- apartheid\". To them, it is immoral that Jews - while they make things extremely hard for Jews elsewhere, ironically and viciously - should desire a national identity, self-determination and a (relatively) secure homeland. \"Open your borders to everyone!\" Quite, and that's the end of Israel and half the world's Jews.

It was done in ancient times when Jews ran financial businesses and were therefore well off and it was done to cause the Holocaust. Which did happen in case you think that was a lie as well. I know because I have people who died in it. All I ask is that you rethink \"tacking\" Jew on because it is a more significant statement that you think.\nSome less fortunate and less educated person will see it and hate the Jews for it. And the Jews will have you to thank. The above correspondence left us shaking our heads.\n\nWhat a case of \"splitting a hair four ways.\" We would like to make it clear, for the umpteenth time, that we are neither anti-Jew nor anti-Semitic, but we are most definitely anti-Zionist. If the writer of this message has enough education to understand some of the problems of the origins of ancient anti-Semitism, i.e. that most financial business was relegated to those of the Jewish religion because charging interest was forbidden to Christians by the <Organization> and that, as a consequence, Jews very often found themselves acting as the middleman between the masses and the ruling classes, then he/she ought to realize that there is absolutely no historically justifiable reason for the land that belonged to the Palestinians (many of whom were Jews, by the way) should be given to a group of invading occupiers who based their claim on a religious belief. The roots of terrorism exist, for the most part, in that arbitrary land theft, and the subsequent occupation by foreigners. Certainly, some less fortunate and less educated people aren't aware of this, including the above correspondent. Indeed, if Israel put down their weapons, there would be no more Israel.\n\nShouldn't that tell us all something?",

    "prompt": "Let everyone beware of even nurturing in his heart any malicious and adverse sentiments against his brother. The chief element of charity is to anticipate the mutual rendering of service, and in paying honor. On the other hand, the manifestations of domineering and of commanding cause alienation of souls. Let everyone abhor every tendency to command or to assume the air of dominating, for it savors of pride and offends charity. If anyone, because of some duty assigned him, has to assume the role of leader, let him not be over-bearing, but rather indicate what has to be done. The advice of the Apostle [Ga 5:13] should be heeded: Serve one another in love. Thus, what St. <Person> said of the ancient monks may be verified: Not one of them 334 CF # Retreat Instructions. MssB The quote is taken from St. <Person>, Homilies on Law, PG 49, CF # 264,\n\n188 SPIRITUAL WRITINGS PART 4 [A] - ORDINARY TIME GENERAL THEMES 188 is seen as the giver, or receiver of wrongs, or to give or receive commands, but all of them are numbered among those serving : Do not talk against one another Often self-love disguises detraction as zeal, charity, or the necessity of defending oneself or others. The real motive is passion. One has to pay the penalty for it to God and to shed many tears over it 338. What good can come from fasting and abstaining from meat when we devour our brothers? He who commits detraction eats the flesh of his brother, chews on the flesh of his neighbor. Thus, St. <Person> speaking to the faithful says: If you go on biting and devouring one another, beware that you are not consumed by one another [Ga 5:15]. Let no one say that he commits detraction only when he utters what is false and when he slanders. When you backbite a confrere, even if what is said is true, you are culpable. The Pharisee in the gospel spoke the truth concerning the publican, because that is what he was, a sinner.

Before I'd arrived, I had completed several financial disclosure forms. Where did I get the money for my Mustang? Did I work in <Organization> School? For whom & how much was I paid. Would I be working in College? If so, for whom. Man these guys wanted to know everything but my jock size. They really had a fit when I indicated I would be living off campus. They even made <Person> complete some documents and confirm her income. Thankfully, prior to the start of school, I'd arranged a job through my <Organization> coordinator, <Person>. When I first met <Person>, I was only told he was a wealthy school supporter and owned several businesses. At our first lunch meeting, I stressed to him the need to be on the up and up as I did not want to risk my eligibility. He told me not to worry; part of his responsibility was to ensure I stayed eligible but at the same time did not suffer financially. He suggested he could find a job for a family member who could then provide me with an allowance. I noted I had a job which would fund most of my expenses; but I thought it might be a good idea for <Person> to have a job to occupy her time. I mentioned she was my recently divorced Mom; young and fresh for her age; great attitude; and I wanted to keep working on improving her self esteem. Without going into details, I mentioned the divorce was the result of an abusive Dad. <Person> mentioned he might have a position for her in one of his businesses and invited me to bring her to his house that Saturday for a barbecue. I agreed and he gave me directions to his home which was out in the country. We arrived at his house that Saturday around 2:00. It was out in the country with no other house in site. As we pulled into the driveway, I noticed the lack of other guest cars. But that thought quickly left my mind as I walked around the car to open the door for <Person>. As I assisted her in alighting from the car, I cautioned her not to embarrass me or disobey. She asked how she could be disobedient to her Master. As you guessed, <Person> is a submissive & my property. For those who have forgotten, <Person> is 34 years of age. 5'2\" tall and about 105 pounds. Very tight muscle tone since she came to me and a nice deep tan with no lines. Originally a brunette, she had become a blonde both topside and on the bush, what little there was of it. Ass tattoo read Property of <Person>. She was wearing a summer weight mini-dress with a thong panty and heeled sandals. Nice make-up with a gold necklace and ear rings. We walked up to the door; she was on my left with her hand on my arm and one pace to the rear. She rang the door bell. The door was opened by a sexy looking black female; about 40 or so I guessed. She was wearing a thong bottom and little more than some jewelry. She introduced herself as <Person> and indicated she was one of <Person>'s personal employees. Seeing her perky titties, I could understand that. She escorted us through the house and out to the rear yard with patio and swimming pool. <Person> was engaged in a conversation with 3 other black dudes; all were wearing skimpy speedo bikinis. There were 5 women in addition to <Person> and <Person>. Like <Person>, they were all wearing thong bikinis and some jewelry. Nothing was on up top. <Person> escorted us to <Person> who turned and introduced himself to <Person> with a handshake and kiss on the lips. As expected, she responded. <Person>, I said, this is my friend <Person>. Thanks for inviting us out here. Great place with lots of privacy. <Person> suggested we be comfortable. I turned to <Person> and told her to remove her dress so the others would not be uncomfortable. As she shed it, I noticed <Person>'s male friends liked what they saw. I told <Person> to make herself useful as <Person> and I withdrew to have a private conversation. I can put her to work this week. He noted she appeared to have a great attitude; but was concerned about how she would act in his topless bar. It catered to Blacks and she would be one of the few white dancers.

Walking in Today I saw <Person> on a punching bag, <Person> on a treadmill, and <Person> stretching on the mat. It was sparring day for me and <Person> had volunteered to “show the dame how it is done” was his exact words. Boy was he in for it. I got into a fighting stance as <Person> stood. He was throwing soft hits, so I let a few connect to stroke his ego a bit. <Person> came to the sideline to watch and had almost ruined my plan when he spoke up “Why are you not giving it your best?” he <Organization> which I replied with a swift kick to <Person>’s chest, knocking him back a few steps.“I am just letting him warm up” I said with a grin. Game on. <Person> came to join <Person> to watch. Going head to head with the Winter Solider was getting me all worked up in the best ways. Seeing his arms moving with strength and precision his massive thigh moving to match. The way his shorts hugged his ass and left nothing to the imagination in the front. <Person> definitely free balled it. Suddenly I am on my back from a right hook and seeing a smug soldier standing above me. His smirk shows that he knows why I got distracted. I jump to my feet and we circle around each other. I speak up “Not bad, for a guy your age” <Person>’s scowl causes <Person> to spit his water before howling with laughter. <Person> chuckles as well causing <Person> to glare at them both until they laugh their way out of the room. \n\n<Person> stalks towards me with an intense look in his eyes. Backing me up to the wall and boxing me in with his arms on either side of me. Pressing his body against mine, he brings his lips to my ear. “I won” he says. “No, I-I lost my footing. Y-You didn’t win” shit, when did I start getting flustered by him. \n\n<Person> move his lips down to my neck, hovering just above my pulse point. I can feel his breath on me, his hard chest against mine, his WHOA! Yeah, I can feel that against me too. That serum really does enhance him. He moves his thigh between my legs and flexes against my core. We start moving together, bodies pressed close. My breathing is fast, I tip my head back and moan. <Person> growls at that and finally attaches his lips to my neck, kissing, biting, marking me. I grab his biceps, the contrast of hot and cold “Bucky…” I say breathlessly. He stops and pulls back enough to separate our bodies. I whine at the loss. “Please <Person>…” I grab for him, foreheads touching, but that is not enough. “Tell me what you want <Person>” <Person> whispers, not wanting to break the moment. “You. Please <Person>, I want you.”He kisses me, lips pressed together, hard. He takes my hands, linking our fingers and pressing them above me against the wall. Pulling away for air he says “I told you, all you had to do was ask”",

That's the bit I have an issue with, White supremacy does not require the holder of the belief to be white themselves.\n\n&gt;White supremacy is blatant in its rhetoric. If you have to explain why something is white supremacist, then it's not because because their rhetoric is completely unabashed and unapologetic.\n\nWhy should I believe that white supremacy must be unabashed and unapologetic. Why is it required that it be unsubtle. This is what I mean when I say you don't substantiate your beliefs. \n\n&gt;White supremacy is not simple racism. White supremacy is the belief that white people are supreme, hence the name. \n\nWhat point are you trying to make here?\n\n&gt;Here's the context. Even further, here's someone else saying the same thing.\n\nTHere's the context, education within the context of the Virginia race alludes to the ongoing, very prominent debate about Critical Race Theory. The way you present it it was as though you were implying that they were saying any mention of education is a dogwhistle, when in reality this statement is about a specific use of the word in relation to a very prominent debate.\n\nSo yes, you were decontextualizing the statement to try to make an argument not made in the source.\n\n&gt;Well I reject that assertion because you have no proof.\n\nThat proof by assertion is not proof? I have to prove that simply asserting something is not the same as proving it. Man, talk about bad faith...\n\n&gt;Great! What's the point of the identity group again?\n\nThat it intersects meaningfully with the experience of the individual. While individuals are meaningfully different within a group, certain patterns and commonalities arise in their relationship with society by virtue of their membership.\n\nEvery gay person is unique in their life and struggles, but unlike straight people, most of us have to \"come out\" by virtue of being gay. That gives us an experience in common.\n\n&gt;According to the left, they don't. According to the left,\n\nAn <Organization> reporter is the left? And how does this suggest that the right is a hivemind?\n\n&gt;You're right, that's only leftists.\n\n&gt;Okay, that was a cheap shot. Sorry.\n\nSave the apology, instead just try to engage with me with charity and good faith.\n\n&gt;Case in point, you could say there was nuance among the Nazis even.\n\nThere was, technically, but their common agreements were inherently vile. Conservatives and liberals have common points of agreement, and none nearly as vile as those within the <Organization>.\n\n&gt;But it will still end only with a progressive outcome. The outcome will not deviate from core beliefs of progressivism. \n\nBut there are *many* progressive outcomes, some of which are more palatable even to conservatives. That's your entire problem, you see it as one thing or the other. Your mind is so deeply polarized that an outcome reached by progressives is a *progressive outcome*. \n\n&gt; Now if you put all of them in a room and force them to come to a decision, you'll get a very diverse outcome.\n\nAnd what is the virtue, pray tell about a \"diverse outcome\" (whatever that is). Don't you fundamentally believe that some outcomes are better than others? The golden mean is not so golden.",

And similarly if anti-gay laws are pro-Muslim, they are pretty much pro-every other religion too. But that doesn't matter because you can't impose religious will from the state level. If anything you just have to barely tolerate their presence, provided they follow the laws and morals of your society.",

These sheets and blankets were definitely not hers – plus, the last time she checked, her bedroom walls were the boring white of dormitories. She felt herself being pulled towards the center of the mattress and when she turned to look at the person laying next to her, everything came tumbling back. She’d gone on a date the night before and fallen into bed with one of the most beautiful guys she’d ever seen. There was no way she was falling back asleep, so she swung her feet over the side of the bed, slightly impressed to find that she was wearing a t-shirt that was definitely too big on her.\n\n \n\nThe wooden floor was cold against her bare feet and creaked loudly as she tiptoed towards the bedroom door. She glanced back at the bed, checking to make sure that the guy was still asleep. He was, so she continued to the door, closing it gently behind her.\n\n \n\n<Person> hadn’t paid much attention to the apartment the night before – she’d been distracted, to say the least – but it was unmistakably a bachelor pad. There was a large flat screen TV, as well as three different gaming systems, and a bunch of empty beer bottles littered the room. The walls were bare aside from one thing – a poster celebrating the <<Organization>> team.\n\n \n\nRealization swept over her as she stared at it. The guy she’d slept with last night was <Person> – <Person>’s <Person>. Part of her wanted to run, to go back to her dorm room and pretend that this never happened, but she knew that she wouldn’t be able to do that. She was in the middle of panicking when she heard a familiar voice from the other side of the room, “<Person>?”\n\n \n\nShe turned to see <Person>, a glass of orange juice in his hand, standing in nothing more than his boxers and a thin white t-shirt. “<Person>. What, uh, what are you doing here?” she stuttered, trying to get the attention off of herself.\n\n \n\n“I always stay with <Person> when I’m in London,” <Person> answered like it was the most obvious thing in the world. There was a moment of awkward silence between them before he added, “When <Person> texted me a warning that he’d be bringing someone home last night I didn’t know that he meant you.” There was an edge of jealousy in his voice that <Person> was sure she was imagining.\n\n \n\n“Oh,” was all <Person> said. She didn’t know what to say to make things less awkward, so she settled for silence.\n\n \n\n“Besides,” <Person> started, flopping back down onto the couch, “I thought you were into girls now. The last time I came to Beacon Hills you were with <Person>, weren’t you?”\n\n \n\n“Yeah, I was,” <Person> replied, not moving from her place beside the lacrosse poster. She couldn’t think of <Person> right now, it just made everything weirder. “But I’m not just into girls…”\n\n \n\n“Yeah, you’re also interested in <Person>,” he interrupted, the bitterness evident in his voice. He didn’t look at <Person>, which bothered her more than she cared to admit.\n\n \n\nIrritated, she stood in front of the TV, trying to force <Person> to look at her. “Say it,” she demanded. “Tell me why it bothers you so much.”\n\n \n\n<Person> looked a little like a kicked puppy and <Person> couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. “Because…” he hesitated, looking down at his hands, “because I like you.”\n\n \n\n<Person>’s stance softened and she sat down on the couch next to him. “You could have said something,” she said softly. The truth was that she’d had a crush on him since she first laid eyes on him and she suspected that it was part of the reason her other relationships had never worked out. <Person>, <Person>, <Person> – they were all great, but her mind constantly went back to <Person> and all of the what if’s and questions that she had. She never thought anything would happen – after what happened with <Person>, she was sure he’d hate her. It was partially her mother’s fault and she’d understand if he blamed her, too.\n\n \n\n“I was going to tell you tonight,” <Person> replied, his voice small. “I’m moving in with <Person> permanently – well, I don’t know if it’ll be permanent, but I’ll be here for longer than two weeks – so I was hoping we could see each other, but if you’re with <Person> I –”\n\n \n\n“I’m not with <Person>,” <Person> interjected, cutting him off.\n\n \n\n“What are you talking about? You’re literally wearing his t-shirt right now,” <Person> replied.\n\n \n\n“It was a one-time thing,” <Person> explained. “We met online, I didn’t even know he was the <Person> until ten minutes ago. I was just bored and lonely and I didn’t think you’d ever like me, so I was trying to move on. It didn’t mean anything, it was just physical…” she stopped talking as a grin spread across <Person>’s face. Her cheeks felt warm. “I have an early class today, so… I’d better go.

We considered a hot tub and champagne or ginger ale but they are non available. Any ideas? The Party Girl's advice is: Maybe you could try some of these: Here's a fun one, no pressure, easy to prepare and do, and can easily tie into your angel theme. Buy or make some baker's dough - enough for everyone. (Recipe: 4 cups flour, 1 cup salt, 1 3/4 cups water, mix and divide into 10 parts. You can color the dough with food coloring if you prefer. Make more if needed for more players.) Give each player a section of dough and ask them to make something that will occur in the future like a new animal or a futuristic house. Have them set their completed projects on a long table for everyone to admire. Then give awards for: funniest, most imaginative, silliest, best use of play doe, etc! Why not have a talent show. Tell people to prepare something for the party and then video tape it and show it to the guests. Everyone must participate to really make it fun. Start off with a blown up picture of <Person> Time and play a game of Pin the beard. Set up a Treasure Hunt in one of the houses and cute poems as clues. Get one of those great box mystery games and everyone be a character. <Person> asked: Occasion: millennium\n\nI have just been elected by my husband and sisters, to throw a Millennium party. We all live 3 hours from each other (me and sisters), we want to be together for the new year, ( we are very close). Their boyfriends will be here too, and maybe a few misc. friends, total people approx. 10-15, small and quaint, but I want something that they will always remember as being the first day of the New Millennium. I'm not rich, but would like to find some great party favors, recipes (food & drink) that will be unusual and not just another family get together of partying. Can you help? Thank you, The Party Girl's advice is: Why not have a grownup pajama party. Have everyone wear funny or colorful PJs and bring blankets and pillows.

    "prompt": "Carmina Burana — at least the first part, “O Fortuna” — is probably one of the most immediately recognizable lyrics we’ve discussed so far in this class. It’s in all sorts of media — TV, films, film previews, sometimes it’s sampled in other music, and so on. So, of course, it does immediately bring to mind a few things in particular; most notably for me, when I hear “O Fortuna,” I think of the battle in Helm’s Deep from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, despite its prevalence, it has never occurred to me to look up the lyrics themselves or its incarnations prior to <Person>’s arrangement from the 1930s.\n\nLooking at the lyrics now, both in their original form and translated, it’s actually a bit more confusing than I anticipated. The general message of the lyric at the start seems to be to do with how quickly luck changes from good to bad; the cruelty of an immutable fate; a request from the speaker to their audience that they mourn said cruelty alongside them. However, it’s pretty long and winding; while the lyrics turn back to the initial song several times, they are interspersed with love songs, borderline erotica, drinking songs, something a bit nonsensical about a roast swan, and odes to the seasons. The winding and not always coherent theme behind the lyrics as a set is kind of jarring to read when compared with the solemn, dramatic tone of “O Fortuna” in particular.\n\nAnother of the things that jumps out to me is the rhyme scheme/ meter; It’s not particularly remarkable but again, I had never really considered the rhyme scheme prior to reading the lyrics. The <Person> version I’m familial with is very grand, orchestral, done by a rather melodramatic-sounding choir; it doesn’t seem to leave much room for whimsy, or rhyme, and the meter of the words sort of gets lost behind the sounds of the rest of the song.->",

    "prompt": "Due to continuous wars knights are regularly called to battle to serve as heavy cavalry. As this has them engaging enemy forces in close-quarters combat (whether mounted or not) each knight wears a full suit of armor. These cover the soldier from head to toe, and while not at all cumbersome they are custom made and reserved for aristocratic knights.\n\nDue to a generation of warfare and a now-limited number of men able to fight, noblewomen have stepped up to the role of battle. Despite much grumbling from the more conservative lords in court, the women have proven quick studies and capable fighters. Indeed, as they wear the same functional armor a man might, it can be difficult, on the battlefield, to discern the unnecessary detail of whether the sword coming down from one’s enemy is from a man’s or woman’s hand.\n\nEach nation uses heraldry and coats of arms to distinguish its warriors on the battlefield. Of these, a mêlée à trois drives the majority of relations in modern campaigns. Stags, lions, and falcons have become something of slang terms to describe each faction.\n\nDaily life in the war (at least for these aristocratic ladies) involves much of what it does for the men: sword fights, warfare and tactics, castles and supply, and rules of kings, queens and treaties. At least one country has also made progress in using jousting as a tournament stand-in for bloodier conflicts, sparing their population from further needless bloodshed through the use of a few extraordinarily trained warriors, with mixed results.\n\n(I do not own the images in the above collage, and all copyrights belong to their respective owners.)\n\nGo to another world …\n\nAdvertisements->",

It did not come with a Chinook user's manual--I found one for a 2000 model which seems close enough.

Same in The Sum of All Fears game (both <Person> games). Cannot think of any other games right now. (Maybe I was a little exaggerating when I wrote \"a lot of\" since in most games you can't even toggle the rof.) So, according to what commando552 wrote, it is possible that the M4A1 with S-1-3-F group in Ghost Recon was intentional, since you control a (fictional) U.S. special force. (And the correct trigger groups: We (at least I) don't take the selectors into account, since in most games you cannot even see them, or are set to safe while the gun goes all rock&roll.)- bozitojugg3rn4ut 07:55, 26 October 2011 (CDT)\n\nWell, yeah, the universe of Tom Clancy is the one where the prototypes and ultra rare things come true, including weapons and vehicles, so the presence of AR-15-type firearm with four-position selector switch shouldn't come as surprise ;) --<Person> 08:48, 26 October 2011 (CDT)\n\nBozitojugg3rn4ut, the selector really should be taken into account, as apart from the receiver markings the selector switch is the only external difference between the regular Colt carbines and the Enhanced version with burst and auto. If it has the regular fire selector and lacks the markings on the receiver, then it is simply and M4 with the wrong fire control group. Is very hard to tell from the Ghost Recon screen shots as there aren't any of the relevant side, but you can just make out that there are only 3 positions marked on the right side of the receiver, making the physical model that of a regular M4/M4A1 rather than an Enhanced M4. --commando552 09:09, 26 October 2011 (CDT)\n\nInterestingly, this discussion is the first result when one Googles \"Colt Model 978\". <Organization>",

Now a sister club has opened in London in Soho and it has already garnered a following among Hollywood stars and Royals alike. Dark, mysterious and excessive, the point of this cabaret club is to shock. Hedonistic and explicit, the cabaret is like no other show in town and is not a place for the faint-hearted. For an experience like no other however, the Box will not disappoint on London's club scene.->",

The memory frequency and amount are also the same as the reference card’s: 6008 MHz and 2 GB.\n\nThus, the Inno3D GeForce GTX 660 Ti HerculeZ2000S is the only graphics card in this review to have no factory overclocking.\n\nThat’s why the only interesting thing about this model is its exclusive cooler HerculeZ2000S. Compact and light, it consists of a dual-section aluminum heatsink with four copper heat pipes (6 millimeters in diameter), two fans in plastic frames, fan faceplates, and a metallic plate with thermal pads for the memory chips and power system components.\n\nThe heatsink fins are soldered to the heat pipes.\n\nThe two 75mm impellers are secured in plastic frames which are hooked on to the sides of the heatsink. Manufactured by <<Organization>>, these fans run on sleeve bearings.\n\nThe speed of the fans is PWM-regulated automatically in a range of 1260 to 3240 RPM. Each fan is specified to consume no more than 3.4 watts.\n\nLet’s see how efficient the HerculeZ2000S is:\n\n\n\nAutomatic fan mode\n\nMaximum fan speed\n\nThe GPU was 71°C hot as the fans were automatically set at 1680 RPM. At the maximum speed of 3240 RPM the temperature was 59°C. That’s average performance compared to the other coolers in this review.\n\nThe low default clock rate helped the Inno3D do well in our overclockability test. We managed to increase its GPU frequency by 105 MHz and its memory frequency by 980 MHz.\n\nHowever, the resulting GPU frequency of the Inno3D card was only 1020 MHz. This is lower than the default clock rates of the <Organization> and Gigabyte cards, for example.\n\nThe peak temperature of the overclocked Inno3D was 72°C, its fans rotating at 1770 RPM.\n\nThat’s good, considering that the Inno3D is quieter than most of the other cards in this review.\n\nKFA2 GeForce GTX 660 Ti EX OC 3GB\n\n<Organization> is the European brand of <Organization>, so if you’re->",

This study is focused on the utility of trie-based data structures for indexing discrete sets that allow to detect such a state faster. An empirical evaluation is performed in the context of index operations executed by a label setting algorithm for solving the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints. Numerical simulations are run to compare a trie with a HATtrie, a variant of a trie, which is considered as the fastest inmemory data structure for storing text in sorted order, further optimized for efficient use of cache in modern processors. Results indicate that a HAT-trie is better suited for indexing sparse multi dimensional data, such as sets with high cardinality, offering superior performance at a lower memory footprint. Therefore, HAT-tries remain practical when tries reach their scalability limits due to an expensive memory allocation pattern. Authors leave a final note on comparing and reporting credible time benchmarks for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints.

What factors are considered in determining treatment? Factors to be considered include the size of the bleed, type and location of aneurysm, and the overall health of the patient. \n\n \n\n\n\n A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the space around the brain. This space is called the subarachnoid space, and it contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds and cushions the brain.\n\nThe most common cause of a SAH is the rupture of an aneurysm. Aneurysms are weak spots in the blood vessels that supply the brain. They are usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and they can occur without any warning signs.\n\nOther causes of SAH include trauma to the head, bleeding disorders, and use of certain medications.\n\nThe symptoms of a SAH can vary depending on the amount of bleeding and the location of the bleed. They may include a sudden, severe headache; nausea and vomiting; stiff neck; blurred vision; loss of consciousness; seizures; and paralysis.\n\nA SAH is a medical emergency, and it requires immediate treatment. The goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding and prevent further damage to the brain.\n\nThe most common treatment for a SAH is surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location and size of the aneurysm. In some cases, the aneurysm can be repaired with a coil or clip. In other cases, the aneurysm <DateTime> need to be removed.\n\nOther treatments for a SAH include embolization and medications. Embolization is a procedure in which a small device is inserted into the aneurysm to prevent it from rupturing. Medications can be used to reduce the risk of rebleeding and to help control the symptoms.\n\nIn some cases, a watchful waiting approach may be used. This is usually only an option for people who are not experiencing any symptoms.\n\nThe decision about which treatment to use will be made by a team of doctors. Factors that will be considered include the size of the bleed, the type and location of the aneurysm, and the overall health of the patient.",

The goal of negotiation is not necessarily to reach an agreement, but to improve the never-obtainable conditions for an agreement, that is, it reduces uncertainty and risk . Negotiation occurs in a variety of places such as commerce (buying and selling), politics, between individuals, etc.\n\nNegotiation is not just an agreement to complete a task together, but the building of social capital . The investment in relationships with others builds trust. Trust and cooperation are essential to creating \"win-win\" situations for all parties involved. Therefore it is necessary that negotiations be taken seriously and performed appropriately (Figure 1).\n\nOne of the most important aspects to a negotiation is that it includes some element of disagreement. When disagreements are present, the possibility of an adversarial relationship between parties becomes more likely. In negotiations, usually one side prefers a collaborative strategy while another party prefers a competitive strategy. The competitive nature of American society makes the U.S. a very competitive place to do business. To <PersonType>, competition is viewed as being \"clean, fair, and square\" in which both parties compete openly for the same prize.

    "prompt": "Personally, I don't suggest BDSM because i've seen countless of times where survivors will use it as a form of self harm and normalize their trauma. I dabbled a bit in the past and it only led to more trauma, but I mainly regret it as it went against my morals before I was was assaulted. Also it has the potential to lead to another assault if proper communication and trust isn't there or if a partner goes too far. I think they are much better ways of coping than BDSM, and I'd advise maybe trying a more loving and non-violent way of expressing your urges.",

In many offices, it is the medical assistant’s responsibility to remove the sutures or staples. It is vital to check the emergency center’s report regarding the number of sutures or staples put in so you can be sure to remove all of them.\n        Be sure to remove the same number of sutures or staples as were inserted by the provider. Sutures or staples that are not removed can become infected, so care in removing all the material is vital. Occasionally patients report that one or two stitches have already come out during a bandage change at home. This should also be noted in the patient’s chart. Follow the steps in Procedure 48–4 for suture or staple removal. Removal of staples is performed with a staple extractor as described in the procedure for removal. Before you remove the sutures or staples, check the number of days the provider who put them in recommended as the time to wait before removal. Ask the provider to inspect the healing wound. After the sutures or staples have been removed, providers might order additional closure materials to cover healing incisions or lacerations (Figures 48–4A, B, C, and D). A support skin closure might be necessary to keep the skin together until the wound is completely healed. The type of supportive closure should be noted in the patient’s chart.",

But she knew that was just a fantasy. . . )After her shower she decided to do something different and give <Person> a treat. She sat down on the edge of the bath, opened her warm soft thighs and carefully shaved every scrap of pubic hair from her. She knew <Person> liked feeling her like a very young teen and, after all, it was a special day. What surprised her was how exciting she found it. She sat for some time just stroking her little girl's cunt, feeling its smoothness. Her inner lips had disappeared while she'd been showering and so now all there was to see was a lovely soft pink slit between her thighs. She remembered how once before, while still at school, she'd sat on a bed admiring just such a slit between just such a pair of smooth thighs. Oh yes; she'd been so in lust with Candy that summer. . . She'd discovered so much about herself that year and even now she imagined from time to time that she could taste <Person>'s pussy. Her thick juices smelt so animal and when they made love her nose, mouth and chin were covered in <Person>'s fluids. She'd never dreamt that she'd ever allow herself to drink another girl's pee, let alone enjoy it, - but she did. Oh God, she'd adored <Person> and her piss had tasted like nectar as it splashed and dribbled all over her face - she just couldn't gulp enough of it to satisfy her desires. And the thrill of standing over a naked <Person>, opening her legs and emptying herself over her lover was almost too much to bear. She was so in love with <Person> - it was if her gushing pee was actually carrying her love and covering <Person> in her desire. Such memories, but such heartache when <Person> had to move away that fall. She thought she'd die sobbing. . . <Person> knew she couldn't allow herself another session on the bed, but she gave into another temptation. Her smooth pussy had excited her, so she fetched out the camera and took plenty of photos of her lovely nude body. Many were very explicitly concentrated on her cunt, both closed like a little girl's and gently spread to allow her inner lips to flower again. Others were of the whole of her, both standing in front of the mirrors in the bedroom and posing on the bed. By using the delay, she could take nice pics of herself from behind as she kneeled and spread her legs. She'd look at them when she was alone. Another excuse for a private session. . . She carefully saved the photos in her secret folder on the PC. God knows what she'd say if <Person> ever found them. It was a little sexy ritual she'd been doing for years. Heavens, tucked away carefully in her lingerie drawer she had Polaroids Candy had taken of her when she'd still been at school! God; <Person> would be so shocked to find those. He'd be so disappointed in her. . . And she knew what she was about to do. It was only sensible to check whether they were still safe. . . She felt to the back of her drawer and her finger closed around the packet with that familiar thrill. Just checking that they're still safe. . . Makes sense just to look inside to reassure herself that they're still all there. . . And there she was, from all that time ago. Her girly grin shining out down the years, love for her friend burning from her eyes. Kneeling on the bed, cupping her adolescent breasts (quite nice, even then, she noted!); here showing her butt and glistening pussy to <Person>; some more, close ups, with her fingers deep inside her; and then others, taken shortly after, with her licking her fingers. Nearly one hundred in total, documenting a few months' young love, exhibiting herself in eager but fairly unsophisticated poses for her beautiful lover. Oh God, even now <Person> could feel the ache in her belly. And here were the most explicit, taken only days before the crushing news that shattered that summer - a few pics of each of them licking the other's pussy. She remembered with a smile that they messed about with the camera's self-timer for ages to get those shots right - but she was still impressed with the results even now. The love shone out from their eyes and there was nothing posed about the enthusiasm - they couldn't have buried their mouths any deeper in their lovers' cunts. She could actually see <Person>'s juice glistening on <Person>'s nose in one shot. It was familiar, the mix of emotions whenever she took this journey back in time. Yes; her hand had strayed down and yes, her fingers were sticky again but it was almost a fondle for comfort. Of equal intensity was this longing, still, for a youthful intense love that had been denied them. True; she now enjoyed herself every week or so with India from the gym for a few hours but she knew that she'd never ever replace <Person> in her heart. That realisation served to put <Person>'s \"sensible head\" back on. She self-consciously gave a little cough; stood up sharply and gave herself a little talking to. Time was moving on and she had plenty to do to prepare for her special night with <Person>. To be continued. . .",

When I'm doing okay-ish it's usually more minor sh and manageable eating disorder thoughts, but when I'm not doing okay (basically since the start of 2020) I bounce between extremes. Had a bad 6 months of my worst sh, covering myself in permanent scars, and then decided to try and stop. It was okay for a bit but then slowly the ED started sneaking up again. Now I'm back in deep anorexia. I'm sure if I manage to get out of this I'll slowly move back to SH again. It's a never ending cycle, and I'm sorry you're experiencing these feelings too. Not eating can definitely be self harm. It's most definitely part of why I do it, though I have a other more ED related reasons too.\n\nSpeaking purely from my experience, dealing with an eating disorder is much more scary and much more deadly. They're also surprisingly easy to develop once you get into a food restriction mindset like this. Not that I want to recommend you go back to cutting, but if you can find alternatives or ways to try and cope that don't involve a restrictive diet I highly *highly* encourage it. Self harm is definitely very dangerous and it covered me in scars and shame, but I have a strong feeling this eating disorder is straight up going to kill me, either in a year because I don't recover or in 30 years because I do but my aging body can't handle all the damage not feeding it caused.",
